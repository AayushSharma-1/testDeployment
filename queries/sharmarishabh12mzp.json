Well, let Lallan, the all-knowing oracle of this city, enlighten you with a touch of sass.\n\nAs for the most renowned temple, it's none other than the Mankameshwar Temple, where prayers are answered like a genie in a bottle. But hey, don't let the name fool you. It's not some wish-granting ATM. You still gotta put in the hard work and devotion, my friend."

Humara Lucknow aapka intezaar kar raha hai!"
