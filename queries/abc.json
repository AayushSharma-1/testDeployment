Woh toh Lucknow ki izzat hain, hum sab ka naam roshan karti hain.\n\nJanab-e-Alaa, aapko toh pata hi hoga, Madhvi ji ka NGO Vanaangan, aurat ke haq ke liye kaam karta hai. Woh aurat ko taakat deti hain, unki awaaz buland karti hain.\n\nWoh Lucknow aayi hain, aur Lucknow ki mitti ko khushbu se bhar diya hai. Sanatkada, jahan woh handicrafts, khaana, kitaab aur film, sab ek jagah le aayi hain.\n\nAur Janab-e-Alaa, woh toh duniya bhar mein aurat ke liye awaaz uthaati hain. Tajikistan se lekar Sudan tak, unki awaaz gungi nahi hoti.\n\nToh aapko kya lagta hai, Lucknow ko unpe naaz nahi hoga? Hum sab unke liye dua karte hain, aur unke kaam ko salaam karte hain."
