Lucknow History
Bara Imambara LucknowThe origin & history of Lucknow is truly intriguing not just to the historians but also to the common man. The history of Lucknow can be traced back to the ancient times of the Suryavanshi Dynasty. It is said that Lakshmana, who was the brother of Lord Rama, laid the foundation of the ancient city. This was near the Gomti River on an elevated piece of land. It was then called Lakshmanpur. However, the city came into notice only during the 18th Century. To know more about Lucknow history, read further the information given below.

It was during the year 1720 when the great Mughal emperors began to appoint Nawabs in order to ensure smooth administration in the province. In the year 1732, Mohammad Amir Saadat Khan was appointed as the viceroyal of Awadh, in which Lucknow was a major province. It was then that the powerful dynasty of the Nawabs, which changed the history of this unknown place. Under the rule of the Nawabs, Lucknow flourished like never before. After 1755, Lucknow grew by leaps and bounds under the rule of the fourth Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula. Lucknow flourished in each and every aspect, which includes poetry, dance, music and the other finer aspects of the lifestyle of Lucknow.

It was when the British came to India that Lucknow was made into an administrative capital. There were many uprisings during the British rule by Indian radicals and many ghastly incidents left Lucknow with bad memories. However, after independence Lucknow was declared the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh by the Government of India. Since then it has progressed beautifully, merging skillfully the past with the present.

The name of Lucknow city can be traced back to the epic ‘Ramayana’. When Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya, after 14 years of exile he gifted this place to his younger brother Lakshman, who is believed to have stayed in Lakshman Teela, a high ground on the banks of the river Gomti. Later, the region was named after his as ‘Lakshmanpur’. There are other stories that do the rounds; Lucknow was named after a very influential person called ‘Lakhan Ahir’ who built the fort ‘Qila Lakhan’. The name ‘Qila Lakhan’ later became Lucknow. Some other sources says that one Lakhu Khan, earlier a non-Muslim having the name Laxan Singh, had lent his name to Lucknow.

The city has archaeological remains dating back to 3000 BC but Lucknow’s foundations were laid in the 13th century A.D. Lakshman Teela, the central part of the city, is believed to have been the site where a fort was built by a clan from Bijnor. By the end of the 13th century, the fort had fallen into the hands of the Sharqi rulers of Jaunpur, who held it till 1476. In the 1540s, the fort was annexed by the Sultan of Delhi, Sher Shah Suri (reigned 1540-45).

The architectural contributions of the Awadh rulers include numerous mosques and palaces (many paintings of these are now maintained at the Art Gallery). Of the monuments standing today, the ‘Bara Imambara’, the ‘Chhota Imambara’ and the Roomi Darwaza’ are notable examples.

Awadh was annexed by the proclamation of 14 February 1856 and the king (Nawab Wajid Ali Shah) was deported to Calcutta, where he died on 21 September 1887. As per the old settlement records of 1862,  2/3rd of Bhadruka village was part of the cantonment area. From the gazette Vol. XXXVII of 1922 (the district Gazetteers of the United Provinces of Agra and Awadh), it is gathered that the ruinous building in Dilkusha Garden was known as Dilkusha Palace, which was built by Sadat Ali Khan as a hunting box and country residence, around which he laid out an extensive park and stocked it with deer and other games. After the first war of independence, the building was occupied by the General Officer Commanding Awadh District. To the south of the ruins, there are few graves of officers and men who fell during the capture of Lucknow. It was at this place, Sir Henry Havelock died on 24 November 1857. In the gazetteer referred to above, it is also stated that Lucknow Cantonment was the Headquarters of Awadh Military District.

Historically, cantonments were places where the army of colonial government had to be exclusively quartered in an effort to keep the armed forces totally insulated from the ruled. Cantonments meant quarters assigned for lodging troops, a permanent military station created by the British government in India for the location of military formation away from the civilian towns and insulated from the Indian nationalist influences. Housing was the core objective. Subsequently, housing itself attracted the civil population to reside in the cantonments and the economic spin-offs attracted other activities. The bazaar area was recognized and the anatomy of the cantonment got clearly defined with military, the bungalow and civil areas clearly defined. The cantonments as local self-government organizations have always remained a puzzle. The civilian population wants to be in it but is uncertain about their status and their future.

Due to repeated demand for reforms by the representatives of cantonment population, the Cantonments Act, 1924 was enacted to introduce local self-government in the cantonments, which contained substantial civil population. The Act was the first model municipal Act for cantonments, but in its implementation, decentralization and democratic norms were largely compromised because of the status of the citizen who occupied the property only as a licensee of the Government.

In 2006 the Cantonments Act, 1924 was replaced by the Cantonment Act, 2006 with a view to impart greater democratization and improve the financial base of cantonments to make provision for developmental activities, etc. Presently there are 62 Cantonments in the country distributed among five Army Commands. The cantonments are categorized as Category I, Category II, Category III and Category IV on the basis of the civil population. As per the latest Census, Lucknow cantonment area falls under Category I, with a population above 50,000.


Vibrant and cosmopolitan Lucknow earned fame as the seat of the Nawabs of Awadh in 18th century. Its history and heritage, however, goes back much further. The city is believed to have been founded by Lakshman, the younger brother of Lord Ram, who gave his name to it. As Lucknow grew it came under the rule of various kingdoms including the Delhi Sultans and the Mughals. The city finally came into its own in the 18th and 19th centuries as the capital of the Nawabs of Awadh, who were feudatories of Mughals. They lavished such attention on it that it came to be known as the “Golden City” and “Constantinople of the East”. The disintegration of the Mughal Empire made Awadh a kingdom in its own right.

The rise of the East India Company in India ushered in a new era which saw the fall of Awadh and the state being annexed to British India in 1856. The last Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled to Kolkatta. The next year, Lucknow emerged as one of the main centres of the Revolt of 1857. In the fierce fighting that ensued much of the historic city was battered. The British regained control of Luknow and it later became the capital of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. Lucknow continued to play an important role and after independence was named capital of the new state of Uttar Pradesh.

Lucknow is the capital city of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and has a rich and vibrant history that dates back to the ancient times. The city has been ruled by various dynasties and empires throughout its history, each of which has left its mark on the city.

Lucknow was initially founded by the Suryavanshi dynasty, which ruled the region during the ancient times. The city was known as Lakshmanavati during this time, in reference to Lord Lakshman, the younger brother of Lord Rama from the Hindu epic, Ramayana.

In the 16th century, Lucknow came under the rule of the Mughal Empire and became a center of art, culture, and learning. During this time, the city became famous for its elaborate Mughal gardens, palaces, and architecture, such as the Bara Imambara and Chhota Imambara.

In the 18th century, Lucknow became the capital of the Awadh region, which was ruled by the Nawabs of Awadh. This was a golden period for Lucknow, as it became a hub of arts, literature, music, and cuisine. The Nawabs of Awadh were known for their love of luxury and patronage of the arts, and this led to the development of a unique Lucknowi culture.

During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Lucknow became a center of resistance against British rule. The British captured the city after a long siege, and it became the capital of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.

After India gained independence in 1947, Lucknow became the capital of the newly created state of Uttar Pradesh. Today, Lucknow is a thriving city that combines its rich history and cultural heritage with modernity and progress.


History of Lucknow starts around 1350 AD, when this place was known as Awadh. Lucknow presently is the capital city of Uttar Pradesh and one of the heritage cities in India. Historically, located in Awadh region, Lucknow has always been a multicultural city. Courtly manners, attractive gardens, poetry, music, and fine cuisine patronized by the Persian-loving Shia Nawabs of the city are popular amongst Indians and admirers of South Asian culture and history. Lucknow is popularly known as the City of Nawabs. It is also known as the Golden City of the East, Shiraz-i-Hind and The Constantinople of India.

The ancient history of Lucknow mentions that after 1350 AD the Lucknow and parts of Awadh region have been under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, the Nawabs of Awadh, the East India Company and the British Raj. Lucknow was one of the major centers of First War of Independence and participated actively in India's Independence movement, and after Independence has emerged as a prime city of North India. Until 1719, subah of Awadh was a province of the Mughal Empire that was administered by a Governor selected by the Emperor. Saadat Khan also called Burhan-ul-Mulk a Persian adventurer was chosen as the Nazim of Awadh in 1722 and he established his court in Faizabad near Lucknow.

The region of Awadh was known as the granary of India and was important advantageously for the control of the Doab, the rich plain between the Ganga and the Yamuna rivers. It was an affluent kingdom, able to maintain its independence against pressure from the Marathas, the British and the Afghans. The third Nawab, Shuja-ud-Daula fell out with the British after associating with Mir Qasim, the deserter Nawab of Bengal. He was finally defeated in the Battle of Buxar by the East India Company, after which he was forced to pay heavy penalties and surrender certain parts of his territory. The British selected a resident in 1773, and over the span of time gained control of more territory and authority in the state. They were reluctant to capture Awadh completely, because that would bring them in direct conflict with the Marathas and the remnants of the Mughal Empire.

History of Lucknow states the rise to growth and fame of the city with its elevation as capital of Awadh by Nawab Asaf-Ud-Dowlah. He was a great philanthropist and gave Lucknow a exceptional and enduring heritage. The architectural contributions of these Awadh rulers include several impressive monuments. Of the monuments standing today, the Bara Imambara, the Chhota Imambara, and the Roomi Darwaza are distinguished examples. One of the long-lasting contributions by the Nawabs is the composite culture that has come to be known as the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb.

The medieval history of Lucknow, in 1798, the fifth Nawab Wazir Ali Khan estranged both his people and the British, and was forced to hand over. The British then helped Saadat Ali Khan to achieve the throne. Saadat Ali Khan in the treaty of 1801 ceded half of Awadh to the British East India Company and also agreed to disperse his troops in favor of a hugely expensive, British-run army. This treaty successfully made the state of Awadh a vassal to the British East India Company, though it theoretically continued to be a vital part of the Mughal Empire in name until 1819.

The treaty of 1801 was important in the history of Lucknow and formed an arrangement that was very beneficial to the Company. They were able to use Awadh's vast treasuries, constantly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. The Nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with lavish lifestyle but with little influence over matters of state. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the British had grown intolerant with the arrangement and wanted direct control of Awadh. In 1856 the East India Company first moved its troops to the border, then annexed the state, which was placed under a chief commissioner - Sir Henry Lawrence.

The province of Awadh was annexed by the East India Company in 1856 and placed under the control of a chief commissioner. In the Indian Rebellion of 1857, rebel forces besieged the garrison based at the Residency in Lucknow. The famous Siege of Lucknow was relieved first by forces after the decree of Sir Henry Havelock and Sir James Outram, followed by a stronger force under Sir Colin Campbell. Today, the ruins of the Residency, and the picturesque Shaheed Smarak offer reminiscences of Lucknow's role in the exciting events of 1857.

The history of Lucknow has special mentioning in both the First War of Independence and the modern Indian freedom struggle. Whether it was the Lucknow Pact of 1916 or the Khilafat Movement it brought the Indian citizens on a united platform against the British rule. The history of Lucknow also includes the Khilafat Movement Maulana Abdul Bari of Firangi Mahal, where Lucknow actively participated and cooperated with Mahatama Gandhi and Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar, Freedom fighter and one of the greatest parliamentarians, Firoj Gandhi was also related to this city.

The modern history of Lucknow started in 1901, when after staying the capital of Oudh, since 1775, Lucknow, with a population of 264,049, was merged in the newly formed United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. However, Lucknow became the provincial capital in 1920 when the seat of government shifted from Allahabad. Upon Indian independence in 1947, Lucknow became the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the previous United Provinces.

From 1394 to 1478 that is for 84 years Awadh had been a section of Sharqi Sultanate of Jaunpur. It was around 1555 that Humayun had converted Awadh as a part of Mughal Empire.

Till 1719, Awadh was a province under the Mughal Empire and administered by an Emperor appointed Governor. During 1720, the Nawabs were appointed by the great Mughal Emperors to ensure a better functioning of the province.  It was in 1722, a new viceroy of Awadh, officially known as the Nizam of Awadh, was appointed named Mohammad Amir Saadat Khan, a Persian adventurer. He later set up his court in Faizabad. This marked the beginning of the flourishing Lucknow during the strong dynasty of Nawabs. Lucknow, building a new history, was like never before.

Awadh was well known as an agricultural storehouse of India. It was a wealthy kingdom, protecting itself from the foreign threats of British, Afghans and the Marathas. Shuja-Ud-Daula, the third Nawab, was defeated by the British in the Battle of Buxar. Following this, he was pressurized to pay huge chunk of penalties and give up parts of his territory.

Lucknow started developing after 1755 under the tenet of the fourth Nawab named Asaf-ud-Daula, a great philanthropist. Lucknow created a name for itself in various different spheres including poetry, music, dance and other aspects of Lifestyle. The Awadh rulers contributed heavily on the architecture of the city. They were enthusiastic enough to raise some of the imposing monuments such as the Bara Imambara, the Rumi Darwaza, the Chota Imambara and other such notable ones.



In 1773 the British appointed a resident and gradually acquired control of more authority in the state. However, the British were reluctant to capture Awadh straightaway so as to avoid the threat from remaining Mughal Empire and the Marathas.

The fifth Nawab of Lucknow, Wazir Ali Khan, in 1798 isolated his people and British, and was required to surrender. The British helped the fourth Nawab to the throne and made him a puppet king.
In the treaty of 1801, Saadat Ali Khan was forced to cede out half of the province of Awadh to the British and agreed to release his troops in favour of the pricey British run army. The British Raj had utilized the province’s vast treasuries by exploiting them for loans at low rate. The Nawabs were made only the ceremonial kings all with all the grandeur, but with little or no influence over administration of the state. It was by the mid of 19th century that British had claimed a direct control of Awadh. Awadh continued to be a division of the Mughal Empire till 1819.

In 1856, the British moved its troops and imprisoned the then Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah. In the revolt of 1857, his 14 year old son Birjis Qadar was crowned the ruler. Sir Henry Lawrence was killed in the conflict.

In the first war of Indian Independence and Indian Mutiny, also known as the Indian rebellion in 1857, the rebels took direct control of Awadh. It took almost 18 months for the British to re conquer Awadh, the period known as the popular Siege of Lucknow. The rebel forces were successful in besieging the regiment based at the Lucknow residency. Under the commandment of Sir James Outram and Sir Henry Havelock, the blockade was relieved. One can recollect the Lucknow’s role in the dramatic incidents of 1857 through the impressive Shaheed Smarak and the remnants of the Residency.

The Khilafat Movement had been active against the British rule. This movement had created a united platform where Firangi Mahal’s Maulana Abdul Bari had taken an active participation and cooperated with Maulana Mohammad Ali and Mahatma Gandhi. Lucknow had remained the capital of Awadh since 1775, and it was only in 1901 that this city, with a headcount of 264,049, was integrated with the newly established United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. When the administrative head was moved from Allahabad in the year 1920, Lucknow transformed into the provincial capital.  Lucknow was declared as the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the former United Provinces, upon the epoch-making Indian Independence in the year 1947.

It is true that Lucknow underwent several bad phases during the rule of the Western country. The uprisings by the different rulers and plenty of appalling incidents left the city in a ruined state of memories. However, since Independence there has been no looking back for this famous city. These historic remains have urged ample of visitors from all over the world. The city has developed to great heights in various spheres.
