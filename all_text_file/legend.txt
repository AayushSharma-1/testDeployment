A legend says the city of Lucknow, located on the banks of river Gomti, is named after Lakshman, one of the brothers of Ram, the protagonist of the Hindu epic Ramayana. According to another version, its original narne was Lakshmanavati ('fortunate' in Sanskrit). The city is located in the heartland of Awadh, the fertile plain between the Ganga and the Yamuna rivers, geographically known as the Doab. During the 18th-century Mughal rulers appointed Nawabs to ensure efficient and smooth administration of the region. In 1732, Mohammad Amir Saadat Khan was appointed as the viceroy of Awadh. Thence arose a powerful dynasty of the Nawabs, which transformed the Awadh region for good. In 1775 Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab moved the capital from nearby Faizabad to Lucknow. To him goes the credit of building magnificent pieces of architecture in the city. During the reign of Nawabs, Lucknow reached the pinnacle of glory and splendour. At various points in time, it garnered many sobriquets like Constantinople of India, Shiraz-i-Hind and the Golden City of the East.
