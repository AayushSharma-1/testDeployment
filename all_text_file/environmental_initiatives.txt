Furthermore, drains exceeding 45 cm up to 1 meter will undergo thorough cleaning at intervals of once every 15 days.


The company will actively participate in Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) endeavors, striving to enhance public awareness of efficient waste management practices.


Commenting on this pioneering collaboration, Mr. Masood Mallick, CEO of Re Sustainability Limited, said, "Entering into this partnership underscores our nation's steadfast dedication to advancing towards a cleaner and greener environment, epitomizing the essence of a truly Swachh Bharat. Through this collaboration, our objective is to realize the government's ambitious vision of achieving 100% segregation in every household. With a longstanding presence as a key player in the waste management sector, we remain committed to continual innovation to drive enhanced efficiency. Central to our efforts is a strong focus on inclusivity, with a workforce of 8500 individuals dedicated to the project, particularly emphasizing women's empowerment and the integration of informal groups.


Leveraging cutting-edge technology remains paramount, with our adoption of unique and innovative methods, such as a zero-emission EV fleet for collecting source-segregated Wet Waste, Dry Waste, and Domestic Hazardous Waste, alongside modern Street and drain Cleaning, Horticultural Waste Collection, establishment, and operation of Material Recovery Facilities, and technologically advanced transfer stations. Our entire fleet is GPS and IoT-enabled, supported by RFID-based monitoring and control systems, overseen in real-time from a state-of-the-art Command and Control Centre.

₹1L cr renewable energy projects in offing

Lucknow: The Yogi government is gearing up to implement 125 projects worth over Rs 1 lakh crore in the renewable energy sector.

According to information from the department of additional energy sources, key players in the renewable energy sector, including Greenco, Tusco, BSEL and ACME Cleantech, are fully prepared to invest in Uttar Pradesh. “Four big renewable energy plants will be set up in Bundelkhand and Purvanchal. The worth of these projects is over Rs 35,000 crore,” officials concerned said. They added that Tusco will set up a 1000-megawatt floating solar power plant in Lalitpur with an investment of Rs 6,500 crores, while Bundelkhand Saur Urja Limited will establish a 1,200-megawatt solar power park in Jalaun, costing Rs 6,000 crores. Further, ACME Cleantech Solutions Private Limited will set up two off-Stream close loop pump storage projects with a capacity of 1250 megawatts in Prayagraj and Mirzapur, costing Rs 6,000 crores.

An official spokesperson said that the UP government was conscious of the environmental hazards associated with the traditional energy sources and was aware of the growing need to switch over to green energy. “Traditional energy sources are limited and their use poses a threat of environmental pollution through emissions. In this context, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is consistently making efforts to increase energy production based on new and renewable energy sources,” the spokesperson said. He added that as a result of the efforts of the Yogi government large projects based on solar energy, biomass and small hydroelectric power are being set up in the state. “Work is already being done in the direction of grid-combined solar power generation and rooftop power generation in the state,” he said.

Now, with the significant investments expected in this sector, not only is Uttar Pradesh becoming a hub for renewable energy, but there is also an increased possibility of creating employment on a large scale.
