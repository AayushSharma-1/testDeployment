During the political turmoil that occurred before and after the Sepoy Mutiny, Lucknow was in the spotlight again. In 1856, the East India Company annexed Awadh placing it under a chief commissioner. The incumbent Nawab Wajid Ali Shah was imprisoned and exiled to Calcutta. In 1857, the rebel soldiers laid a siege on the Residency which housed the garrison of British troops stationed in Lucknow. The end result was a human tragedy. The ruins of the residency still stand - a silent testimony to the political drama that unfolded here many moons ago. After Shah was exiled one of his wives, Begum Hazrat Mahal and her band of supporters, rebelled against the British. For a while, they captured power in Lucknow but eventually had to retreat. Still later from 1919-1922 the activists of the Khilafat Movement, staunchly supported by Maulana Abdul Bari of Firangi Mahal Lucknow, gained a foothold in the city.
