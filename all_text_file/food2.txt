Lucknow is the birthplace of Awadhi cuisine

Lucknow is where Awadhi cuisine started, inspired by the cooking style of the Nawabs. These Nawabs, who ruled India in the Mughal times, carried many regional dishes from their travels across India. Once in Lucknow, these dishes blended with local ingredients, resulting in the tasty Awadhi cuisine we enjoy today.
Lucknow’s traditional food often includes a lot of spices, dairy like yoghurt, nuts, dried fruits, and many fresh vegetables. You can see the Mughal touch in the biryani, made with many spices and aromatic basmati rice. Meat dishes, ranging from creamy kormas to the drier rogan josh, are also favourites. Grilled foods like shami kebabs, seekh kababs, and galouti kebabs are widely enjoyed as possibly the best street food in Lucknow.
Lucknow cuisine is also renowned for its iconic sweets such as the delectable shahi tukda and sheermal – both of which are made using a blend of nuts, saffron and cardamom-scented milk. Other famous desserts include kheer, malpua and the famous Awadhi zarda.

Biryani in Lucknow is a fragrant symphony of delicate flavours, where long-grained Basmati rice mingles with succulent pieces of meat and a blend of aromatic spices. Unlike the Hyderabadi or Bengali versions, Lucknawi biryani is characterized by its lightness, subtlety, and unique method of cooking called ‘dum’, where the dish is sealed and cooked over a slow flame. This ensures a harmonious infusion of flavours.
