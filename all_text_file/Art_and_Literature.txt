With tourists avoiding New Delhi because of the harmful air quality and smog, Lucknow, just over an hour’s flight from the capital, is a great alternative, offering a rich mix of architecture, craft and culinary heritage.

The capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh, on the banks of the River Gomti, Lucknow has been ruled by the Mughals, the Nawabs of Awadh, and the British through the ages, and its history remains visible in its buildings, arts and cuisine.

When Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab of Awadh (state rulers of the area now known as Uttar Pradesh), shifted the state capital from Faizabad to Lucknow in 1775, it led to a cultural renaissance. An exodus of architects and craftsmen landed there from Delhi, and many other poets, artists and learned men from all around made Lucknow their home. It is said that artisans from as far as the Uzbekistan capital Tashkent, and masons from Isfahan in Iran, were brought to Lucknow by the Persian Nawabs.
One of the important crafts of Uttar Pradesh is Chikankari, which entails delicate and traditional hand embroidery. This form of handicrafts is mainly practiced in Lucknow. It is done on fabrics like chiffon, muslin, organza, organdie and silk. Chikan saris and Kurtas which are the perfect summer wear.

A melting pot of art, culture, cuisine and architecture, the bustling city of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, preserves its essence of grandeur in its kaleidoscopic experiences. From a vibrant culinary scene and exquisite historical monuments to its rich art and culture and vestiges of colonial charm, the city of nawabs, as it is popularly called, is as welcoming as is the warmth of its people.
Chikankari
A delicate hand embroidery technique done on fabrics like chiffon, muslin, organza, organdie and silk, chikankari is one of the most important crafts in Lucknow. The word 'chikan' means embroidery, and this form of art incorporates 36 different stitching techniques. In the beginning, only white yarn or muslin cloth was used. Stitching is done on the back of the cloth whereas the design is made on the front by tiny, running stitches. There are three main types of stitches – flat, embossed, and jaali (net effect). Due to a Persian influence, flowers have a permanent place in this art form. Typical chikankari motifs include creepers and vines. However, the types and styles in which these flowers are made keep varying with fashion trends. Today, there are hundreds of retailers of chikankari fabric across the country. In Lucknow, the lanes of markets are dotted with shops selling chikan work in various forms. You can pick up shirts, kurtas, bedsheets, table cloth, pillow covers and many other items adorned in chikankari. 

The technique is supposed to have been introduced by Mughal empress, Nur Jahan, in the 17th century.  Another legend speaks of a thirsty traveller, who stopped at a village in Lucknow, and requested a villager for water. Humbled by the villager’s hospitality and generosity, he imparted the skill of chikankari to him as an act of gratitude. 
Zardozi
This signature embroidery art of Lucknow has been around for centuries and has been been accorded a Geographical Indication tag (GI). Lucknow is the primary centre for zardozi, and apparels featuring this embroidery can be found in well-known shops of Chowk area, as well as other bazaars in the city. In Persian, 'zardozi' means gold embroidery. 

The original process, which is known as “Kalabatun”, made use of silk threads wrapped in real gold or silver; the thread was subsequently sewn onto different fabrics, and then embellished with gold threads, spangles, seed pearls, wires, beads, sequins etc. In the times of the nawabs, zardozi was used to decorate tapestries and wall hangings. Even elephants and horses were covered with heavy cloths adorned with zardozi. In that era, this form of embroidery was considered a luxury, since it could only be done on heavier fabrics like velvet, satin and silk. Therefore, only the royalty could afford it. It was regarded as a symbol of opulence. 
Perfumes/Attar
The city of Lucknow is known for its fine perfumes that are available in beautiful bottles of cut-glass work. Perfumers in Lucknow make delicate and lasting fragrances using various aromatic herbs, spices, sandal oil, musk, essence of flowers, and leaves. Attar, derived from Persian word 'atr' means fragrance. Perfumes or attars have been in use in Lucknow since the 19th century. During the days of the nawabs, perfumes were also added to food to enhance the taste and aroma of the dish. It is said that Mughal empress, Nur Jahan, would bathe in water perfumed by rose water, thus encouraging people to start extracting scented oil from the flower. 

Legend has it that the practice of using natural substances to derive scents came from ascetics who would burn roots and other plant material during their meditative bonfires. The sweet smells lingered for a while, inspiring nearby villagers to experiment with flowers to find the right tones. Once they had attars down to a science, the villagers started presenting these fragrances to the nawabs, who would spray the halls and walkways of the palaces before the arrival of guests. Since attar also has therapeutic properties, when sprayed in public spaces, it would subtly put visitors at ease.  
Surrounded by terraced lawns and gardens, the Residency, overlooking River Gomti, is one of the oldest buildings in the city. Originally, it was built as a large complex of residential quarters, armoury, stables, dispensaries, worship places, for the British General, a representative of the British East India Company, during the rule of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan between 1780 and 1800. Today, the ruins of the building reflect its former glory and allow one to soak in its colonial charm while visiting. The Baillie guard gate, named after Residency’s first resident, Col John Baillie, gives you a glimpse of the architecture and design you will see inside. The treasury, which was completely destroyed during the sepoy mutiny of 1857, and a marble plaque honouring the brave soldiers of that time, are the two structures you will see as you walk towards the main buildings. The banquet hall, still bearing intricate carvings and featuring high ceilings, with a pretty fountain in the centre, will transport you back to the time of grand ballroom dances and opulent parties. Opposite the hall stands Dr Fayrer’s (resident surgeon) house, used as a shelter for the British during the mutiny, as well as a makeshift hospital.

Translating to martyrs' memorial, Shaheed Smarak is a white marble structure standing amidst a beautiful park. It was built in 1970 by the Lucknow Development Authority on the banks of River Gomti opposite the Residency, in order to commemorate hundreds of soldiers who lost their lives during the 1857 freedom movement of India. The monument was designed and conceptualised by celebrated architect Prasanna Kothari, and emulates the style of Amar Jawan Jyoti, located at the India Gate in New Delhi, which also pays tribute to the thousands of jawaans who gave up their lives for the security of the nation. You can pay your respect to those who sacrificed their lives for the country, and spend some time exploring the vast grounds while stealing a moment of peace and serenity. 
Charbagh Railway Station, one of the two main railway stations in Lucknow, is an architectural marvel that features the best of Rajasthani and Mughal styles, mixed with British influences. The station appears like a chessboard from the sky, with turrets and domes resembling chess pieces. From the front however, it resembles a Rajput palace. Such is the ingenuity of the construction that large water reservoirs are beautifully hidden inside the building. Charbagh was designed by JH Horniman, an Englishman, in 1914. 

Bara Imambara is perhaps the most recognisable and popular symbol of Lucknow, and is visited by thousands of tourists all year round. 

Built as a relief project to provide work to the people of Awadh during a famine, the Bara Imambara was constructed by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula during the 18th century, and its name essentially translates to a big place of worship. Its architecture, with delicate arches and jharokhas (windows), boasts Rajput, Mughal and Gothic influences. 

There are two main entrances to the Imambara, both guarded by enormous gateways. The ceiling of its central hall is said to have used interlocking bricks without any beams or pillars for support. The structure has an amazing maze of corridors called 'bhul bhulaiya'. It has a network of more than 1,000 labyrinthine passages with some leading to entrance or exit points and others heading to deadends. There are also 489 doorways standing at the mouths of confusing, twisting paths. The grave of the nawab is located under a canopy. At one time, there was a mile-long tunnel underground running to River Gomti that added mysticism to the location. 

Surrounding the main edifice are lush, well-maintained gardens that are perfect for a leisurely stroll, or for just relaxing and soaking in the splendour of the Bara Imambara.

Lucknow is full of stellar examples of Nawabi architecture, but there are few that compare to the Chhota Imambara, built by Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah in 1838. The Nawab’s mausoleum, as well as his mother’s, are present here.

The complex comprises of the tomb of Princess Zinat Algiya, the daughter of the king of Awadh, a watchtower known as Satkhanda, a ceremonial gateway called Naubat Khana, and the Husainabad mosque. The Chhota Imambara boasts a gilded dome, several turrets and beautiful chandeliers. It comprises five doorways and Islamic verses have been carved into its exterior walls. There are two main halls, namely Shenasheen and Azakhana. The latter is embellished with gilt-edged mirrors and colourful stuccos, as well as exquisite chandeliers that are said to have been brought from Belgium. It is because of these lamps and crystal chandeliers that this iconic building is also known as the palace of lights. 

The Imambara stands to the west of the Bara Imambara, with the exterior of the building boasting a golden dome with fine calligraphy. It is at its finest during festivals and other special occasions, when the whole structure is lit up and glimmers like a jewel.

Shahnajaf Imambara is a white-domed mausoleum constructed by Nawaz Ghazi-ud-din Haider at Paltan Ghat. He was the last wazir (minister) and the first king of the state of Awadh in 1816-1817, and has been buried at Shahnajaf, which is why this Imambara is also known as Karbala. His wives, Mubarak Mahal, Sarfaraz Mahal and Mumtaz Mahal, are also buried here. The Imambara was a tribute and symbol of his devotion to Caliph Hazrat Ali, the husband of Fatima, who is said to be the favourite daughter of Prophet Mohammed.

This Saturn-shaped building is situated at Surajkund Park and is a major attraction of the city. The planetarium boasts a state-of-the-art projection system that is renowned for special effects that thrill children and adults alike. A must-watch is the Cosmic Journey show, which dives into the Chandrayaan mission to the Moon, provides an explanation as to why Pluto has been removed from the solar system, and even showcases different galactic structures and various nebulae. It is also known for its art projecting system, digital sound and lift-ramp for the specially-abled. 

The Indira Gandhi Planetarium is especially crowded on the weekends and during the summer holidays, when children from all over Uttar Pradesh come to see the galaxy come alive before their eyes. The first show on Saturday and Sunday is in English, while the rest of the shows are conducted in Hindi. There is a nominal entry fee, which is waived for the specially-abled. 

The foundation stone of the planetarium was laid in 1988. The goals of this initiative were to popularise science and the study of astronomy among the youth of the state through quizzes, interactive sessions, exhibitions and competitions. 

The state capital is becoming a hub of Hindi literature, feel several littérateurs, poets and writers. They say that’s the reason why more and more activities celebrating Hindi literature are being organised in the city. However, some caution that absence of money for writers, thinkers and poets could hurt the prospects of Hindi literature in Lucknow.

In this era when people prefer reading books on the internet, Lucknow writers are coming out with more and more books in Hindi on a variety of subjects,” said poet and Hindi literature critic Sarvesh Asthana.

“Books of four eminent comic poets will be released at the same event at the Sangeet Natak Akademi here on ‘Hindi Diwas’. These include Mukul Mahan’s ‘Yamlok Mein Ghotala’, Rajendra Pandit’s ‘Pandit Ji’, Pankaj Prasoon’s ‘Lampatganj’ and my book ‘Wo Balkani Wali’. All will be released by deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma in the presence of former president of Hindi Sansthan Dr Udai Pratap Singh and eminent writer Dr Gopal Chaturvedi. I think its will be a one-of-its-kind occasion.”

CHINHAT POTTERY:


In India, pottery making is an art common to almost every part of the country. Every state has its own unique art of pottery making be it the “Blue Pottery” of Rajasthan, the “Terracotta” of Madhya Pradesh or the “Chinhat Pottery” of Uttar Pradesh. Every form of pottery is uniquely creative and unequivocally beautiful as it involves great deal of art, skill and craft of the potter who gives exquisite shapes and designs to a mere handful of clay.

Lucknow city, famous for its rich culture and heritage, has another creative dimension to it in the form of Chinhat pottery. The form of pottery, named after the place where it is mainly practised, has added to the already rich pool of indigenous and ingenious craft of the city.

Chinhat Pottery is mainly done in the Chinhat area which lies at the eastern outskirts of the Lucknow city, on Faizabad Road. The place has emerged as a famous hub for pottery in the Uttar Pradesh state, and has attracted tourists as well. Chinhat pottery is a beautiful and creative art of handicraft that has life added at the hands of the native potters skilled in the art of pottery-making.

Lucknow and the Chinhat Pottery

The city of Nawabs has been the centre of art and craft since ages. Lucknow city carries a rich legacy of creativity and culture behind. Right from chikankari and zardozi, to pottery-making, Lucknow has been a thriving ground for the local skill and craftsmanship.

Lucknow has a long standing history of pottery-making since the time it was ruled by the Mughals and Nawabs. The basic form of pottery-making in the city was all about the coating of the bases of the tanks with clay, which went on to include the making of colourful figures of different races on these tanks. It also involved carving of fruits of clay, a form of pottery that is still prevalent at large, in the city.

With the origination of the craft at Chinhat, the art of pottery-making in Lucknow thrived and still continues to serve as a source of bread and butter for a large number of potters. In fact, the close proximity of Lucknow helps in acting as a good market for the finished products. Pottery-making emerged as a lucrative industry with the recent trend of using pottery for beautification of landscapes in hospitality industry and house interiors too. However, today, the once prosperous trade looks desperate for an immediate overhaul and stimulus for better future of both the potters and the business as a whole.

How it all started in Chinhat?

Chinhat used to be a small hamlet on the outskirts of Lucknow, along the Lucknow- Barabanki road. Chinhat gained popularity due to the commencement of pottery-making industry Picture of pottery shop at chinhat, Lucknow. Captured by lucknowpulse team.that helped the village secure an important position as a pottery-making hub in the state.

The craft of pottery making is very old and started with the pilot project that was launched by the Planning Research and Action Institute (PRAI) of the State Planning Department. The pilot project was launched in the year 1957 with a two-fold objective of training the unemployed youth of the area in pottery making and to establish small units to be managed and controlled by the learners themselves. The local people of Chinhat saw potential of making it big and profitable in the field of pottery-making with the help of this project. The institute received 5000 applications and soon the efforts started bearing fruits of success. The products were received well both in the national and international market.

The PRAI also developed a kiln in Chinhat to further the cause of developing the pottery-making industry. The craft also received support from the U.P Small Industries Corporation (UPSIC). UPSIC made the entire work procedure more organized and provided support to the entrepreneurs to develop the pottery-making industry in Chinhat.

What all they make?

Chinhat pottery comes under the category of Glazed Terracotta pottery and Ceramics. The pottery has a rustic look to it and carries an earthen appearance. The glazes are usually green and brown-coloured while the designs are put on the usual white and cream bases. The firing of the Chinhat pottery is done at 1180 to 1200 celsius. The products include mugs, bowls, vases, cups and saucers. The blue on white, toy tea-sets from Chinhat are also very popular apart from the mugs, flower vases, and the leaf-shaped plates. The designs are at times in geometric shapes and the final products are beautiful pieces of creativity, skill and hard work put together by the potters of Chinhat.

For potters, pottery-making is not just an occupation to earn livelihood, it is their work which they worship. However, the recent spurt in the availability of cheap Chinese products in the markets and ignorance of the authorities has caused trouble for the potters. The industry still has huge potential of turning into a big profitable business for the state. But, efforts need to be stepped up to promote the craft at both national and international levels as it holds a great potential for both Lucknow city as well as the local craftsmen.

Do find a chance to visit the exquisite Chinhat pottery village on your trip to Lucknow to be able to have the real feel of the whole process of pottery-making. You may also indulge in some shopping for your house if you like the pottery art native to Lucknow, the city of Nawabs.

Lucknow city, known for its rich heritage, mannerisms and the Nawabi culture has another dimension added to it in the type of Chinhat pottery. This is named after the location where it primarily originated and had put into the already abundant pool of ingenious and indigenous craft of the city.

Chinhat Pottery was primarily produced in the Chinhat region which is at the eastern outskirts of the Lucknow city, on the Faizabad Road. Chinhat had emerged as a popular hub for pottery in the Uttar Pradesh back in the 1970’s and the terracotta industry was already thriving there for a long time.

Chinhat attracted visitors not only from India but from all over the world. Chinhat pottery is a creative and beautiful art form of handcrafted pottery which generated bread and butter for the local craftsmen. For the potters there, pottery making was not just an occupation to generate a livelihood, it was the work of theirs which they worshipped.

The beauty of the Chinhat pottery faded away because of the apathy from both the Central and the state government as well as the competition from pottery centre in district Khurja, which led to the shut down of this industry in the year 1992.

The Chinhat pottery cluster was initially started by the Planning Research and Action Institute (PRAI) of the State Planning Department in the year 1957 as a trial project to provide employment, eradicate poverty and to make the villagers self-sufficient in the Chinhat region. PRAI ran the units as Independent, semi-independent and depended on units for about the next 10 years before it got transferred to the U.P Small Industries Corporation (UPSIC) for better organization.

The main speciality of Chinhat pottery is that it is totally handmade with no machinery involved unlike other crafts like making ceramics. Chinhat pottery was refined, well designed and decorated in a colourful form and consisted of Kitchenware, decorative bowls, plates, cup-saucers, containers, flower vases and vessels etc. It is a type of glazed pottery with geometric designs.

In the beginning, women were not allowed to work in the pottery kilns, only the male potters were involved. But with time women also became a part of the pottery making process equally. 11 units of kilns were opened up in Chinhat by the UPSIC, and farmers from the nearby villages as well as potters used to work here together. Around 300- 400 people were involved in the work.

Prabhakar Nath, an 80-year-old man has been in the craft of pottery making in Chinhat, ever since 1978. His father too was involved the same craft. His three generations have been a part of this business. He says, “The problem started to arise as UPSIC, stopped providing the basic facilities and amenities to the potters by not providing them credit facilities”.

He adds, “Raw materials and tagnecks which were earlier given free of cost by PRAI were no longer given freely anymore. Earlier PRAI used to assemble all the products made by the 11 kilns and used to help in its marketing, supplying and exporting. But UPSIC did not follow the same trend and they stopped helping in the supply and export of the pottery produced there.”

As a consequence, the entire the burden of marketing and supplying fell on the pottery units themselves. They started selling their products on their own with no help from the UPSIC, mostly in the nearby local markets of cities like Kanpur, Faizabad and Lucknow. The transportation cost of procuring the raw materials also increased.

UPSIC had developed one more centre for the pottery making, side by side along with Chinhat, which is called Khurja. Khurja, still is a popular market for pottery and pottery kilns still run there as UPSIC opened new units in the region and better facilities and services were provided to the potters there whereas on the other hand no steps were taken to improve the already dilapidated condition of the Chinhat potters in terms of basic facilities and services. Chinhat pottery was more artistic whereas Khurja pottery was more industrialized.

The UPSIC started its own production unit in Chinhat after sometime called the Mother Factory unit where the same pottery was produced alongside with other independent, semi-dependent pottery kilns around. The production done by the UPSIC factory was quite inferior as compared to the local Chinhat pottery. The pottery produced by them lacked finishing, was uncleaned and lacked the beauty of the original handmade chinhat pottery. The products produced by the UPSIC themselves turned out to be a huge flop in the market and its production was stopped later.

UPSIC was under a loss of Rs. 2 crores and the mother unit got shut in the year 1992 by the UPSIC and with that began the doom in the Chinhat Pottery industry when UPSIC stopped providing raw materials to the kilns.

The small pottery units with limited economy could not procure the raw materials on their own from the outside and only 4-5 units among them could work by procuring the materials together in a group from Khurja. The furnaces established in the kilns were all coal-based and with time coal became way too expensive. The cost of production, as a result, started increasing and became more and more with each passing year.

With time the wages of the labourers increased as well along with the increase in the prices of raw materials. The raw materials were procured through Khurja as the small factory owners could not buy it directly from the mines added to the transportation cost. The middlemen in Khurja supplied the raw materials to the Chinhat factories and took a huge amount as their commission.

Prabhakar Nath laments, “After a lot of pleading by the potterers and factory owners and writing letters to the government it was decided that Khadi Board Commission might take up the Chinhat cluster in its own hands, but nothing fruitful came out of it. The government left the Chinhat potterers on their own fate”

A senior official from State MSME and Export Promotion Ministry says, “Government tried its best to revive the Chinhat pottery in 1992, in order to remove the tag of a sick industry from Chinhat pottery financial aid, special packages and proper assistance was given, a master plan was also chalked out, where subsidies were granted by the government but by that time the demand for the Chinhat pottery had reduced drastically, even after providing them with modern machinery, the units could not gain profit and couldn’t be resurrected. On the other hand, Khurja was nearer to the main market of Delhi-NCR, the transportation was easier and Khurja pottery was much more in demand than of Chinhat’s because of its better finishing and packaging, that is why it is still thriving and we still have its demands from abroad as well.”

More than half of the units in Chinhat district were shut down completely by 1997 whereas some of the units started to manufacture Terracotta disposable items in the remaining ones and these factories till this date carry out terracotta production in Chinhat. The labourers who were involved in the pottery making were mostly farmers from the nearby villages who were hit hard by the shutdown, to escape poverty and unemployment they went back to their original activity of farming and agriculture.

The senior MSME official points out that, “Handmade pottery is not feasible to use in homes on a daily basis because it lacks strength and durability, people buy pottery products nowadays just to keep them as decorative items in their display boxes and do not use it for general household consumption. Chinese products have replaced the traditional Indian pottery now in terms of consumption.”

Mr Prabhakar Nath wishes that under the new scheme of ODOP - One District One Product launched by the state government if the government could try to bring back to life the traditional Chinhat Pottery industry. He adds,“ It has been more than 22 years since I had to shut down my factory at Chinhat. If new advanced furnaces and machinery are involved along with doorstep availability of raw materials to the factory the pottery can be vivified”.

A senior government official from UPSIC says that “Under the One District One Product scheme (ODOP) for Lucknow district, Zardozi and Chikankari work have already been finalized but a ‘Mati Kala’ Board has been set up under the Development Commissioner Of Handicraft (DCF) to promote traditional pottery, for its revival and sustainability in the long run and loan is given to the artisans under the MUDRA scheme. There are promotional events organised by the MSME department, like trade fairs, exhibitions, local expo’s where pottery products are put on display to increase awareness about the handicrafts. If anyone is willing to set up an independent unit by themselves, the government is always ready to help them with the new startup schemes and One Window redressal system.”




DASTANGOI:


Abdul Halim Sharar in Guzishta Lucknow calls this art as ‘extemporaneous composition’. The development of Urdu language in Lucknow was not only limited to letters and court culture. Contributions were made at all levels of society which caused the language to improve, broaden and assume new aspects which were sources of interest to all classes. One such effort was Dastangoi, the art of story telling. Stories with imaginative instincts were recited by dastangos of Lucknow in 18th & 19th century. Mahmood Farooqui described that in 1881, buoyed by the success of the Amir Hamza story, Munshi Newal Kishore Press, Lucknow embarked on a highly ambitious literary print project. He assembled some of the leading Dastangos of Lucknow and commissioned them to produce the entire Hamza narrative as it existed in oral and written records. The result, by the end of a labour of twenty five years, was a series consisting of 46 huge volumes, each about a thousand pages long. It is the crowning glory of Urdu literary tradition and the summit of a thousand years of the Indo-Islamic composite culture.

Abdul Halim Sharar in Guzishta Lucknow calls this art as ‘extemporaneous composition’. The development of Urdu language in Lucknow was not only limited to letters and court culture. Contributions were made at all levels of society which caused the language to improve, broaden and assume new aspects which were sources of interest to all classes. One such effort was Dastangoi, the art of story telling. The Persian word dastangoi is compound to two words dastan and goi which means telling a dastan or story. As we already know India is a land of rich culture and literature, the number of dastans ranges from various fields like: war, pleasure, beauty, love and deception. The art of Dastangoi is like painting pictures by barely using words and expression, and the ability to make a deep rooting connection with the audience which was once lost, is regaining its popularity. It is believed that this art actually originated in Arabia when in pagan times assemblies were held for telling of tales. Even though dastans had many principles and many stories, ‘The tale of Amir Hamza’ composed in Persian by Amir Khusrau was the basis for all other narrations. Amir Hamza, travelled the world in his infancy. His stories are marked by presence of djiins, acts of bravery, prophecies and fairies. Similar sort of stories with imaginative instincts were recited by dastangos of Lucknow in 19th century. It was looked down upon by colonialists and was considered as immoral and obscene. Women were also restricted from participation. It was 1928, when Mir Babar Ali a famous dastango passed away that the art saw its end.

The first modern Dastangoi performance took place on 4th May 2005 at the India International Auditorium after the recent revival of the art by Mahmood Farooqui and his dedicated team which includes Darain Shahidi, Ankit Chadha, Danish Hussain, Fouzia, etc. They wish to spread the lost art of dastangoi from Delhi to Lucknow to Lahore to New York and across Globe. They have added innovations to the art of dastangoi like participation of women which was earlier restricted only to men, Fouzia being one of the main woman propagator of the art. They have also added many new themes to the art of dastangoi like cult personalities, fictional stories, on cities, writers and even on current issues like sedition! Some of their popular pieces are Dastsan Azar Jadu Ki, Dastan-e Lahore, Dastan Akhtari, Dastan-e Partition, Dastan-e Chouboli, Tilism-e Hoshruba, etc. Mahmood Farooqui described that “In 1881, buoyed by the success of the Hamza story, Nawal Kishore Press, Lucknow embarked on a highly ambitious literary print project. He assembled some of the leading Dastangos of Lucknow and commissioned them to produce the entire Hamza narrative as it existed in oral and written records. The team of three writers Mohammed Husain Jah, Ahmed Husain Qamar and Sheikh Tasadduq Husain, joined later by others, started work on reproducing in print the virtual entirety of the Hamza tradition. The result, by the end of a labour of twenty five years, was a series consisting of 46 huge volumes, each about a thousand pages long. Each of the volumes could be read as an independent entity, or one could read it as part of the whole. The 46 volume Hamza cycle is the crowning glory of Urdu literary tradition and the summit of a thousand years of the Indo-Islamic story telling tradition”. Mantoiyat ( Dastan on Manto ) was executed in Lucknow on the birth centenary of Sadat Hasan Manto in 2012 and Dastan Dhai Aakhar Ki ( Dastan on Kabir ) was executed in Lucknow Literary Festival 2013 by Lucknow Society as an initiative to promote and revive dastangoi in Lucknow city.

Dastangoi has picked up the story of hockey wizard KD Singh ‘Babu’ who took forward the legacy of Major Dhyan Chand to a new level and helped India win gold at the Olympics in 1948 and 1952.

KD Singh was born in Barabanki and was fondly called Babu. He is widely known for his mesmerising passing ability and is considered by many to be the greatest dribbler of the game comparable only to Dhyan Chand. Dhyan Chand is widely regarded as one of the greatest field hockey players in history. Known as The Wizard or The Magician of hockey for his superb ball control, he played internationally from 1926 to 1949.

Dastangoi is the ancient art of oral story-telling that is seeing a revival, more so here, in Lucknow.

Himanshu Bajpai noted Dastango of Lucknow said, “I have always been a fan of KD Singh. Moreover, hockey and Lucknow have a special relationship as the city has produced legends like him, Jaman Lal Sharma, Sayyed Ali, Sujeet Kumar. This special relationship has found a place in my Dastangoi scheduled on November 21 at Jaipuria Institute of Management as a tribute to the legend.


“I don’t know whether the people will like this experiment of creating a Dastan on the life of a sports legend as I have no one sponsoring this event. I hope the sports directorate will like this presentation and get this organised at other places, as this will inspire youths to take up sports instead of sitting in front of a computer.”

He said, “I have done Dastangois on the life of Rani Lakshmi Bai, and other heroes of India’s freedom struggle but this Dastan has been very close to my heart as it has the potential to start a sports revolution in this part of the world.”

Himanshu Bajpai said, “The story idea is picked from the book ‘The final Whistle’ by Kunwar Raghvendra Singh, nephew of KD Singh. Besides, I have met his son, VV Singh, to get minor details about his life. I have tried to portray each and every aspect of his life starting from childhood to old age. To get an insight of his life, I met a number of hockey players who learnt the tricks of trade from him. It was an experience to interact with players like Ashok Dhyanchand, (son of hockey wizard Major Dhyan Chand) Sayyed Ali, Aslam Sher Khan, etc.”

The Dastan will give details about the first match which he played as a 13-year-old in the Dewa Mela. He played against noted players like Mohammed Hussain but he led his team to victory and his last hockey match as a player and as a coach.

VV Singh said, “The Dastangoi was conceptualised when we were talking about the contribution of KD Singh to the state. He was the one who established the Sports College, Sports Hostel in Lucknow for sportspersons. He never got his due in his life in his own state despite being considered the best in hockey during his time in the world. He actually deserved Bharat Ratna.”

Dastangoi (Urdu: داستان گوئی) is a 13th century Urdu oral storytelling art form. The Persian style of dastan evolved in 16th century. One of the earliest references in print to dastangoi is a 19th-century text containing 46 volumes of the adventures of Amir Hamza titled Dastan e Amir Hamza.

The art form reached its zenith in the Indian sub-continent in the 19th century and is said to have died with the demise of Mir Baqar Ali in 1928. Dastangoi was revived by historian, author and director Mahmood Farooqui in 2005.Syed Sahil Agha has amalgamated Dastangoi with music & singing in 2010.

At the centre of dastangoi is the dastango, or storyteller, whose voice is his main artistic tool in orally recreating the dastan or the story. Notable 19th-century dastangos included Amba Prasad Rasa, Mir Ahmad Ali Rampuri, Muhammad Amir Khan, Syed Husain Jah, and Ghulam Raza.

Dastangoi has its origin in the Persian language. Dastan means a tale; the suffix -goi makes the word mean "to tell a tale"

Indian urban anthropologist Ghaus Ansari ascribed the origin of dastangoi to Pre-Islamic Arabia, and detailed how the eastward spread of Islam carried dastangoi to Iran and then to Delhi in India. From Delhi, dastangoi made its way to Lucknow in the 18th century, aided by the Indian Rebellion of 1857, during which several artists, writers and dastangos moved from Delhi to Lucknow.

In Lucknow, dastangoi was popular across all classes, and was regularly performed at diverse locations including chowks (city squares), private households, and afeem khana (public opium houses). "It became so popular among opium addicts that they made listening to stories an important element of their gatherings," wrote Ansari. "The prolonged intoxication and prolonged stories narrated by professional story-tellers was mostly combined. Each afeem khana had its own story-teller to entertain the clients; whereas, among the rich, every household used to appoint a dastango as a member of its staff." According to Abdul Halim Sharar, the noted author and historian of nineteenth century Lucknow, the Art of dastangoi, was divided under the following headings:"War", "Pleasure, "Beauty", "Love" and "Deception".


Dastangoi was revived by Mahmood Farooqui in 2005. Since then, he has performed thousands of shows across the world.
The early dastango's told tales of magic, war and adventure, and borrowed freely from other stories such as the Arabian Nights, storytellers such as Rumi, and storytelling traditions such as the Panchatantra. From the 14th century, Persian dastangois started focusing on the life and adventures of Amir Hamza, the paternal uncle of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Indian stream of dastangoi added storytelling elements such as aiyyari (trickery) to these tales.

URDU:


During the nineteenth century, the centre of Urdu literature shifted from Delhi as most literary men migrated to other parts of India like Hyderabad, Patna, and Lucknow. The Lucknow court emerged as the centre of Urdu poetry as it received poets from Delhi with much enthusiasm.[17] Chief among these poets were Khaliq, Zamir, Aatish, and Nasikh.[18] Other poets included Anis and Dabir.

The troubles at Delhi towards the end of eighteenth century and beginning of nineteenth century proved to be a blessing for the people of literary taste at Lucknow, as the ongoing issues on a day-to-day basis and the environment there was not conducive for the men of thoughts and those having seas of expressions thriving in their hearts and minds. The situation developed into a scenario where intellectual migration started to happen and choices were very limited where courts were willing to welcome the poets. Out of possible centres, the main were Hyderabad, Patna and Lucknow. With these choices, Lucknow was not only the nearest in terms of distance but also comparatively secured as both, the court and the people of Lucknow were enthusiastic to embrace the poetic genre looking for solace and the surroundings were fertile. Though, it was realised very early that there was a gulf of differences in the ideology of the poetry of two cities.

Journey of Urdu Poetry

The poetry of Lucknow was very particular about the words as compared to Delhi, it gave itself up to external things, such as outward ornament, rather than beauty of thought, whereas Delhi school was very focussed on the subject and thought. Delhi had vigour for style and depth of thought against the verbal accuracy and idiomatic usage prevalent at Lucknow. This alliance resulted in a new blend of rules, language and idioms, restricted poetic license and laid down laws for prosody and figures of speech, specially similes and metaphors. In the desire for power in the use of words, Lucknow increased the length of the lyric and the number of rhymes.

The court of Lucknow being run by the Nawab having Shia faith laid a strong base for those poets who mastered in the art of narration took up the penning of elegies or Marsiya, the poetic description of the tragic events at Karbala. This art was primarily evolved in Persia and was brought to Lucknow purely on religious grounds. In the beginning, these elegies were short devotional poems and little attention was paid to their literary quality. With the passage of time, this form of poetry occupied the vacuum of epic that was not present in the Muslim society.

The epics of Karbala include historic narrative, moral and didactic teaching, description of natural scenery and delineation of human emotion. Lucknow gradually turned out to be a nursery that was to boast of nurturing the raw talent and bring out the best from the future generations who gave Urdu some new dimensions and unparalleled place in the history of literature. Practically it would not be possible to talk about all the poets in one article, however the best of attempt is to highlight the era that gave Lucknow a place and significance in literature.

Here we go through some great names who laid the foundation of poetic mastery at Lucknow during 18th and 19th centuries:

Meer Taqi Meer :

Faqeeraana Aaye Sadaa Kar Chalay
Miyaan Khush Raho Hum Dua Kar Chalay

Born in 1723 at Agra, his first visit to Lucknow in 1748 opened the gates of literary fancies for the place and the court of Asaf-ud-Daula extended an invite for him to stay there permanently. However, Meer migrated to Lucknow much later in 1782 to live here until his death in 1810. His Kulliyaat-e-Meer consists of six Deewan and his Masnavi Muamalaat-e-Ishq is one of the greatest known poems in Urdu literature. Basing his language on his native Hindustani, he leavened it with a sprinkling of Persian diction and phraseology, and created a poetic language at once simple, natural and elegant, which was to guide generations of future poets.

Mir Mustahsan Khaliq : The son of Mir Hasan and more famously the father of Mir Anis was one of the earliest elegiac writers in North India. Born in 1774, Khaliq lived until 1804 and during his relatively small life, he took his ability to the heights where on one occasion at his native place, Faizabad, he recited his work with such an effect that Aatish, the legendary of his times, gave up to recite his own lyrics saying that it was not needed when Khaliq was there.

Muzaffar Husain Zamir : A contemporary of Khaliq, Zamir was known better as a pair to former and was a learned man. He is credited to have taken elegies to an advanced level, both in terms of the length as well as the narration. He took into account the battles, the horses, accoutrements and the natural scenery. His works described historical events with a view to increasing religious fervour. He is known for his tough language and fancied style of writings.

Shah Tura’ab Ali Qalandar : The second head of the Sufi Khankhaah (monastery) at Kakori, Shah Tura’ab Ali Qalandar composed marvels in poetry in praise of Lord Krishna. His composition ‘Saant Ras’ is by far considered to be a masterpiece depicting Awadhi language. Falling in line with the philosophy of mysticism, his poetry captured the hearts of those who searched to find the consummation of self. He was one of the first Sufi poets of his times to lay the foundation of communal harmony through the powerful cord of literature.

Karamat Ali Shahidi : He was a native of Bareilly but brought up in Lucknow, he lived a careless life initially but became very religious person during the later course of life. He was known for writing poems in difficult meters. His recorded teachers were Mushafi and Shah Nasir. In one of his odes, Shahidi had expressed his desire to die in Madina and as the destiny had in store, he passed away at Madina during his pilgrimage in the year 1840.

Daya Shankar Kaul Nasim : A native Kashmiri Pandit, Nasim won accolades primarily on his one poem Gulzar-e-Nasim which he wrote at the age of 22. He was a student of Aatish and he is also credited to have presented the earliest Urdu translation of The Arabian Nights. Nasim passed away in the year 1843 at the age of 32.

Haider Ali Aatish : One of the key figures that earned Lucknow a name in Urdu literature that it is today, always remembered for his association with Nasikh, so much so that Aatish gave up writing after the death of Nasikh and he himself passed away in the year 1846. Aatish was a natural poet and used simple, colloquial language, the language of everyday speech. He had a powerful physique and was a swordsman himself. Aatish is considered to be one of the finest Urdu poets had compiled two collections of his poems.

Imam Baksh Nasikh : A contemporary of Aatish, they jointly correspond to the style of Mir and Sauda of earlier generation. Nasikh is regarded as the master of words, he was very fond of using Arabic and Persian words and made minimal use of the local dialects. Nasikh may be credited for making a more common use of the word ‘ghazal’ that was earlier largely practiced as ‘Rekhta’. On the other hand, Nasikh’s poetry is also labelled as bombastic and obscure, that his poetry which was largely influenced by Persian was full of sound and fury but was devoid of poetry.

Agha Hajju Sharf : A pupil of Aatish, Hajju is considered to be one of the torch-bearers of the movement that was against the usage of Persian in Urdu poetry. Abdus Salam and Safir Bilgrami have pointed out that Hajju rejected the whole vocabulary of the wine shop that was prevalent in Urdu Poetry.

Vazir Ali Saba : Another pupil of Aatish, born in 1795 and is credited with his collection of lyrics by the name of ‘Ghuncha-e-Aarzoo’ or a bunch of desires. This collection is known for its idiomatic usage of Urdu.

Muhammad Vazir Vazir : He was a pupil of Nasikh and was regarded as the greatest of the minor poets of his times. He was a very religious man. A contemporary of Saba, his work titled Daftar-i-Fasahat is known for its imagination and subject matter.

Muhammad Khan Rind : Born in 1797 at Faizabad, he lived initial years at his native place before he reached Lucknow. He had so much of influence of Aatish that he destroyed all his works that he compiled during his early years and started from scratch to compile Guldasta-i-Ishq. He took up the religious life during the middle age and passed away in 1857 on the way to Makkah where he was to perform his pilgrimage.

Ali Ausat Rashk : Born in 1799, a pupil of Nasikh, Rashk gave himself up almost entirely to improve the language and laying down rules for it. He was very fond of the colloquial, which he employed freely in his poems. He became a great authority on all points connected with idioms and use of words. He had two collections of poems, namely Nazm-i-Mubarak and Nazm-i- Giraami, the third collection that was said to be the best, was lost. He also compiled Urdu dictionary called Nafs-ul-Lughaat. He passed away in 1867.

Muhammad Riza Barq : A pupil of Nasikh, Barq was fond of far-fetched metaphors and similes, he wrote voluminously as he was attached to the Royal court under Wajid Ali Shah. Barq followed his Royal master into exile and wrote a rather uninspired account of his own loneliness before he died towards the end of 1857.

Hatim Ali Beg Mihr : Born in 1814, Mihr is better known as a correspondent to Ghalib, than for his poetic prowess. Mihr’s biggest achievement refers to Ghalib’s admiration of his work Shuaa-i-Mihr. He is also credited with his collection of poems by the name of Almas-i-Darakhshaan.

Imdaad Ali Bahr : Born in 1810, Bahr was one of the chief disciples of Nasikh, along with Vazir and Rashk. Bahr was a poor man who used to sit on a mat everyday and likeminded people used to visit him and discuss poetry. He was sponsored by the Nawab of Rampur, Kalb Ali Khan who paid him the salary and attached him to the court but Bahr returned to Lucknow out of his own choice.

Ismail Husain Munir : Born in 1819, Munir was a wanderer poet and most famous of his work is Ma’arij-ul- Mazameen, he was a typical poet of his time. The collections of Munir’s poem are titled as Muntakhibat-uI-Aalam, Tanvir-ul-Ash’aar and Nazm-i-Munir. He passed away in the year 1881.

Mahdi Hasan Khan Aabaad : His compiled anthology is known as Baharistan-i-Sukhan and he wrote a great deal of verses. The best known lyrics penned by Aabaad are Nigaristan-i-Ishq.

Wajid Ali Shah Akhtar : All the Nawabs of Lucknow demonstrated their writing abilities but the most prolific among all has been the name of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah during his reign from 1846 to 1856. The poetic description of his exile Huzn-i-Akhtar is a wonderful piece of writing. Some of the unpublished manuscripts of Wajid Ali Shah are still preserved with the British Museum. His last sh’er, penned reportedly upon his departure from Lucknow is often proclaimed as his masterpiece:

Dar-o-Deewar Pe Hasrat Se Nazar Karte Hain
Khush Raho Ahl-e-Watan, Hum Tu Safar Karte Hain

(At some places, the second misra’a (line) of the couplet is reported as: Rukhsat ! Ahl-e-Watan, Hum Tu Safar Karte Hain)

Muzaffar Ali Khan Aseer : Born in the year 1800, Aseer was one of the courtiers of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah who is known for his articles on grammar and prosody. Aseer also became more famous because of his pupils, namely Ameer Ahmad Minai and Ahmad Ali Shauq. He died in the year 1881.

Arshad Ali Khan Qalaq : He is regarded by some as one of the greatest writers of Masnavi (poetry of romances), he is also credited with his work on Qaiserbagh and some other eulogiums of his master Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. Qalaq’s work Tilism-i-Ulfat became very popular at its time and had a high regard in the works of romanticism.

Mahdi Ali Khan Zaki : He is known for his book on rhyme and prosody titled Yaad Gir, published in 1848. He also authored the short story of Punjab in the year 1850. Zaki is reported to have spent most of his life wandering from one court to another.

Ali Khan Darakhshan : He is known for his moral and didactic poems in a good colloquial style with rather fanciful conceits. Along with Barq, Darakhshan accompanied Nawab Wajid Ali Shah into exile.

Agha Hasan Amaanat : Born in 1815, Amaanat is credited with writing the first Urdu drama Indar Sabha along with number of elegies in honour of Imam Hasan and Imam Husain. He passed away in the year 1858.

Babar Ali Anis : Born in 1802, Anis is regarded as the one who took the art of Urdu elegiac poetry to the highest point in terms of literary artwork. Remembered as a pair to Dabir, jointly they surfaced as a combination as that of Mir and Sauda of the previous century. Anis boasts to have a bloodline filled with poetic abilities, his great-grandfather was Zaahik, grandfather was Mir Hasan and father was Khaliq. The trend continued even down the line and his son Nafees earned a name for himself, his grandson was Jalees and even his great-grandson Aarif held on to the poetic baton for seventh consecutive generation. One of the most renowned names of Urdu poetry, Munis was the brother of Anis. He and his family are famous for the usage of pure and idiomatic Urdu that makes the works very simple, easy and flowing. Anis’ works are published in over four volumes and most famous among all remains Waaqia-i-Karbala, a volume of selections so connected as to make a single story. Anis passed away in 1874 at Lucknow.

Salamat Ali Dabir : Born in 1803, Dabir completes the duo with Anis, his poetry demonstrated of more scholarship and bears a strong power of imagination. The ideas of Dabir were sometimes fanciful and clever rather than impressive, and his pathos was much true to life than the real sorrow depicted in the verses of Anis. He wrote about half the works of Anis and primarily confined himself towards penning elegies. In 1858, Dabeer went to Murshidabad and in 1859 to Patna. Dabeer left a worthy son in Mirza Muhammad Ja’afar poetically surnamed Auj who followed in the footsteps of his father. He was a great scholar and was regarded as an authority on prosody on which he had published a treatise. Dabeer died in year 1875 at Lucknow.

It is imperative here to mention the greatness of poetic and intellectual level of Anis and Dabir with this reported incident, when Anis was critically ill, Dabir visited him and casually asked “Kahiye Anis, Tabiyat Bakhair Hai”, without wasting any time but with great difficulty, Anis responded “Jaam Bhar Chuka, Chhalakne Ki Der Hai”. This signifies the relations between the two masters and their poetic abilities.

Mir Muhammad Nawab Munis : The lineage and family of Munis was itself enough to launch him as a poet but despite being son of Khaliq and brother of Anis, his works left a place for himself and signify his own identity. He had a great command over the language which he showed in his elegies. His power of recitation was far-famed but by and large he remained to be a very religious man and was hardly seen unless he was reciting his elegies at religious gatherings. His works were published in two volumes. Munis passed away in the year 1875.

Nawab Mirza Shauq : A pupil of Aatish, Shauq is mainly known for his four Masnavi, namely Bahar-i-Ishq, Zahr-i- Ishq, Lazzat-i-Ishq and Fareb-i-Ishq. His works possess an excellent choice of rhymes and enjoyed considerable amount of popularity. Shauq passed away in the year 1871.

Sayyid Mirza Ta’ashshuq : He was the son of Mirza Mir Uns and brother of Husain Mirza Ishq, hailing from the literary background his elegies surpassed all others of his time in the pathos which Ta’ashshuq infused. His words well chosen and his ideas were striking despite very ordinary quality of lyrics at times. He passed away in the year 1891.

Husain Mirza Ishq : He was the elder brother of Sayyid Mirza Ta’ashshuq and penned elegies that were published in two volumes. His popularity was con␣ned as he usually did not participate in the public functions and was very much confined to solace. He passed away in the year 1890.

Khursheed Ali Nafis : Descendant of a great lineage, Nafis was the son of great Mir Anis and nephew of Munis. Born in 1819, Nafis had the quality to hold enthralled the audiences which went to hear him recite. He wrote a great deal, but only one small volume has been published. He strongly followed the traditions of the family and passed away at the dawn of twentieth century in 1901.

Mustafa Mirza Rashid : Born in 1845, the son-in-law of the great Mir Anis and nephew of Ishq and Ta’ashshuq, Rashid ventured with writing many love lyrics. He is said to have evolved the style of penning elegies with the description of spring. Rashid chose to adopt the styles of his uncles and managed a reasonable space for him in the literary circuit. He passed away in the year 1917.

Ali Muhammad Aarif : Born in 1861, the grandson of Nafis and great-grandson of Mir Anis, Aarif primarily resembled Nafis in his works, poetic style and character. Having started with love poems, he later on confined to elegies and earned a name for himself. He passed away in the year 1916.

Ameer Minai : Born in 1828 to the family of Maulvi Karam Mohammad Minai, he was a descendant of Sufi Saint Makhdoom Shah Mina of Lucknow. It was not easy for a poet to establish himself in the era of Ghalib and Daagh but Ameer Minai mastered that and not only this but also he was one privileged poet to have witness the times of both Ghalib and Iqbal. He is widely known not only for his poetic prowess but also as a scholar, writer, translator and connoisseur of the Urdu language. His range of study stretched from law to logic and from mathematics to history. He not only penned Ghazal but also Naat, poetic praise of the Prophet Mohammad PBUH. His collections of Ghazal are Meerat-ul- Ghaib and Sanamkhane-e-Ishq, whereas his collections of devotional prose are Khayaabaan-e-Aafreenish and Mahaamid-e-Khatam-un-Nabiyyeen.

The above reference cannot claim to have covered the entire list that contains the men of poetic legacy but it is a nutshell attempt to remember most of them.

At the onset of Twentieth Century

This was the time when Lucknow was at the forefront of the political developments happening all across the country and its impact was all but visible in the literary works of the then poets, writers and authors. Lyrics of love were overshadowed by thoughts of revolution and the sorrows of elegies were crying further with the canvas of religious ideological differences.

The flavour and colours of the poetry that were emerging during the beginning of twentieth century were very different from the previous generation.

The people of Lucknow and surroundings woke up to the new century with very different poetic voices, a great name of Ameer Minai had just passed away at far-off Hyderabad but the later years blessed the city with some of yet another greats like Maulana Syed Fazl-ul-Hasan Hasrat Mohani, Choudhary Jagat Mohan Lal Rawaan, Shabbir Hasan Khan Josh Malihabadi, Brij Narain Chakbast, Asrarul Haq Majaaz, Anand Narain Mulla, Aal-e- Ahmad Suroor, Mohammad Shafi Khan Bekal Utsahi, Ali Sardar Jafri, Waali Aasi, Khumaar Barabankvi, Saghar Khayyami and many more.

The all new breed of poets continued the legacy and despite all the turmoil that was happening during the first half of the century, Urdu poetry continued to flourish with some of the great names and some that could not achieve the much deserved recognition based on their literary acumen.

Zareef Lucknowi

Born in 1723, Meer was orphaned and left to subsist and survive on his own at the age of 11. After living in Delhi for a while, he moved to Lucknow on the invitation of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, where he lived till his demise in the year 1810. One of the pioneers of Urdu literature, Meer Taqi Meer (also spelled as Mir Taqi Mir) was a man without an address in life and death (his place of burial is untraceable now).

Reminisced for his poetic pathos and melancholy, Meer is revered as the 'Khuda-e-Sukhan' (God of poetry) in the world of Urdu literature. It is said that it was Meer who constituted a new elite language in Lucknow called 'Rekhta' or 'Hindui' which is an amalgamation of Urdu and Persian. Here is a heart-rendering verse from the legend that has been used multiple times by various lyricists and writers.

"Patta patta boota boota haal hamara jaane hai

Jaane na jaane gul hi na jaane baagh to saara jaane hai"

Famous works: Zikr-e Meer, Faiz-e Meer, Mu'amlat-e-Ishq, Kulliyat-e-Mir

Mirza Hadi Ruswa

Born in Lucknow as Mirza Muhammad Hadi in 1858, this legend from the City of Nawabs wrote under the pseudonym 'Ruswa' in poetry and 'Mirza Ruswa' in novel writing. Ruswa sharpened his writing skills under the tutelage of Mirza Dabir and after his death, Ruswa sought help from his son Mirza Jafar Auj.

All of Mirza's literary writings, poetry, and other compositions were created in Lucknow before he moved to Hyderabad in 1920. Some of the writings that he is renowned for are based in Lucknow, for instance the novel based on Umrao Jan — the renowned courtesan of the city. Here's a couplet by the poet, who breathed his last on October 21, 1931,

"Dil lagane ko na samjho dil-lagi

Dushmanon ki jaan par ban jaegi"

Famous work: Umrao Jan Ada

Safi Lakhnawi

Born as Syed Ali Naqi Zaidi in 1862, in a Zaidi Syed family of Awadh, Safi Lakhnavi started writing at the tender age of 13 under the pen name of 'Safi'. Back when having an Ustad was the norm for every writer, this literary legend used to write on his own without the help of a guide. Safi's poetry is known for its simplicity and sweetness. It reflects the prevalent socio-political and cultural state of Lucknow of his time.

His words, being reformist and innovative in their tonality, made him popular among the common folks as a people's poet. Safi, who breathed his last in 1950, gained his own distinctive identity by his unusual way of writing, unlike the traditional Urdu poetry. Here's a couplet by the poet that highlights his unique style of poetry,

"Dekhe baghair haal ye hai iztirab ka

Kya jaane kya ho parda jo uthe naqab ka"

Famous works: Aagosh-e-Maadar, Tanzeem-ul-Hayaat, and Deewan-i-Safi.

Hasrat Mohani

An eminent poet, an activist and a freedom fighter of the Indian independence movement, Syed Fazl-ul-Hasan was born in 1875. Famous as 'Hasrat Mohani', his allonym, this legendary poet played an important role in keeping the original form of ghazal alive at a time when it was being neglected. One of the first people to call for 'Azaadi-e-Kaamil' (complete independence) from the British rule in 1921, Hasrat coined the famous clarion call of Independence movement, 'Inquilab Zindabad'.

A staunch opposer of the partition, Mohani was a member of the Constituent Assembly that drafted the Indian Constitution as well. Even after his demise on May 13, 1951 in Lucknow, his legacy lives on through his ghazals which have a classical yet modern appeal to it. Here is a couplet from his famous ghazal that featured in the movie Nikaah in 1970,

"Chupke chupke raat din aansu bahana yaad hai

Ham ko ab tak aashiqui ka vo zamana yaad hai"

Famous work: Mushahidat-e-Zindaan

Majaz

Born in 1911, in a town of Lucknow (formerly called Awadh), Asrarul Haq was as a contemporary of some renowned names in Urdu literature like Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Sardar Jafari and Sahir Ludhianvi, among others. The poet wrote under the nom de plume 'Majaz'. His words, unlike others, were famed for being a slightly musical.

Majaz garnered fame for his lyrical poetry which was more adored at the time than Faiz's 'Mujhse Pehli Is Muhabbat' and Sahir Ludhianvi's 'Taj Mahal'. With his demise in 1955 in Lucknow, Majaz left a void in the world of poetry that couldn't be filled by anyone else. Here is a famous Sher by the poet known for his revolutionary and romantic poetry,

"Kya kya hua hai hum se junoon mein na puchhiye,

Uljhe kabhi zameen se kabhi asmaan se hum"

Famous works: Shab-e-taab, Aahang, Saaz-e-Nau, Aligarh Muslim University Tarana (Anthem)

Anwar Nadeem

Anwar Kamal Khan, born in Malihabad on 22 October, 1937, carried forward the legacy of his ancestors like Josh Malihabadi by committing himself to Urdu literature under the pseudonym 'Anwar Nadeem'. Anwar was not just an acclaimed Urdu writer and poet but also a satirist, humourist, critic, dramatist, journalist, theatre and film actor, short-story writer, screenplay writer and an actor.

Famous for his impeccable Lakhnavi accent, Anwar gave a power-packed performance in J P Dutta's film Umrao Jaan. Selected to play the role of Mir Hadi 'Ruswa', the author, he ended up doing the narration of the 2006 movie as well. Born and lived in Lucknow all his life, Anwar breathed his last on 9 August, 2017.

With more than 13 books to his credit, his work relishes the true essence of Lucknow which is loved and appreciated by the readers. Here is a timeless couplet by this multi-talented legend of Lucknow,

"Ho sakta hai koi humein bhi dhunde in banjaron mein,

Jaane kis ki khoj mein kab se phirte hain bazaron men"

Famous works: Safarnama, Maidan, Jai Shri Ram, Kirchein.

KALAI WORK:



the kalai-walas of Lucknow. The artisans, who, through their intelligent application of metallurgy, make copper and brass[3] vessels safe for culinary use. The art of ‘kalai’ is essentially a process involving deposition of tin on the surface of copper and brass vessels, and is alternatively called – ‘tinning’. This is done to ensure that a uniform tin coating obstructs any possible reaction between the vessel and the organic acids present in the food or the environment.[2] The people practicing the art of kalai as their profession are popularly called kalai-walas. Surprisingly, other than tin, they only require heat, nausadar (local name for ammonium nitrate) and caustic soda to make these vessels medicinal, harmless and enduring in nature.

Given the concision involved in both method and material, it seems strange that this pragmatic technique isn’t widely known. In contrast, one might find that even after being pushed to oblivion by society, personal blogs and YouTube [5] channels run by art and cuisine enthusiasts can’t seem to stop espousing the beauty and benefits of kalai. This makes it imperative to investigate – why?

‘In Lucknow, the kalai work is divided between 5-6 shops scattered about the main Yahiyaganj market and some in Chowk. In dark, dingy, old edifices that could comfortably belong to the last century, as in fact they do, artisans perform the interesting task of donning a utensil fit with kalai.’[6] While a few artisians have certainly managed to hold on to the practice and sustain themselves, this piece of writing relies only on online sources of information. The data has been extracted from various personal blogs, newspaper clippings and Youtube videos available on the internet, which have then been categorized and analysed under three themes – science, society and sustenance. The delicate balance of these three traits may as well be the perfect brewing point for an intervention that is truly exemplary in nature. The insights from the analysis could lead us to better understand what constitutes a ‘good design’ and how we – as designer – can make a design ‘good’.

To fully understand and imagine the art of kalai, it is necessary to set our premise in the time when copper and brass utensils were the mainstay of the kitchens. ‘This was the time when the reverberating call, “Bhande kalai kara lo” (get your vessels re-tinned) was the most banal and everyday sound of the city.’[7] The practice would unfold a series of events that would almost appear like magic show to first-time spectators. The soiled and tarnished brass and copper kitchenware would play the protagonist in an hour-long show and emerge gleaming and sparkling like new. However, it must be noted, there is practical scientific wisdom to this ‘art’.

Copper and brass have time and again been applauded for being the best metals to cook food in. Their high conductivity spreads the heat evenly across the surface of the utensil, cooking the food thoroughly and evenly. This imparts a unique lingering flavour that makes the food taste better and also by some means ensures the nourishment of the digestive system. [7] On the flip side, these metals are prone to reacting with the organic acids present in the food, leading to discolouration, bitterness and even production of toxins. The kalai-wala circumvented these ills through kalai and made the vessels safe for use. This made him an invaluable addition to ‘the whole social spectrum ranging from royal bawarchiwalas (chefs) to regular households.’

The fascinating show of kalai-wala wouldrequire only a few ingredients but a lot of practice. Mr. Nausad in his interview by Chef Harish Tiwari explains that when work was abundant, artisans used to move around on their bicycle carrying a blower, charcoal, tin metal strips and other necessary tools and chemicals. The process would start with a thorough cleansing of the utensil with caustic soda to remove any foreign impurities. In the next step, it would be washed with an acid that contains a gold purifying compound ‘Sufa’, a salt and another element. It would then be immediately wiped clean to avoid leaving a mark. Simultaneously, a temporary blast furnace was prepared by digging a pit in the ground and airing the charcoal ember with bellows. As the utensils heated up, a tiny piece of tin was placed on its blasting hot surface. It would melt instantly and then be rubbed on the utensil using a cotton pad dipped in nausadar (ammonium chloride) powder. The process would culminate in a hissing sound from the newly tinned scalding hot vessel being dipped in water to cool it down. [4] It is to be noted that there is astounding finesse in being able to curl this molten tin to form a perfectly uniform layer inside a 600o C hot vessel while an opaque white-grey smoke billows off and engulfs the eyes. This is an art, perfected over decades to achieve a flawless, glossy and smooth surface every single time.

To draw better insights about design thinking and design approach, the question that must be posed is:

What are the qualities embodied by kalai that we could learn from?

Every exemplary practice appears to be an ideal entwinement of science, society and sustenance. In isolation, these might seem like easy targets, but to establish an equilibrium that benefits all and harms none is an art that indigenous practices have mastered to a great degree, making them the recipient of everyone’s awe and appreciation.

To understand the science behind kalai, it is essential to first understand the science of using copper and brass kitchenware. These metals due to their high-conductivity allow for even cooking and efficient use of fuel (firewood), procuring which used to be a physically intensive task. It’s also said that when water is stored in copper vessels for a significant amount of time, traces of it get dissolved in water. In scientific parlance, this effect is called ‘Oligodynamic effect’. Due to copper’s toxic effect on living cells, a wide range of moulds, fungi, algae and other harmful microbes present in the water get easily destroyed. Simply put, it’s nature’s aqua-guard. [10]

Using copper vessels not only helps in water filtration but also provides the required daily dose of the essential micronutrient. This ‘stimulates the brain, promotes bone strength, aids in digestion, regulates body fat, is anti-carcinogenic, regulates the functioning of thyroid glands, prevents joint pains, aids in haemoglobin synthesis, maintains acid-alkaline balance in the body, helps in healing of internal wounds and slows down ageing due to its antioxidant property.’ [10] These assorted benefits further endorse the practice of kalai which forms an inert barrier that preserves the positive aspects of copper and brass while keeping their adverse effects (that arise due to their high reactivity) at bay.

Before the invention of stainless steel, copper and brass were widely used for a variety of purposes. The practice of kalai, by tackling the issue of corrosion in these metals benefitted the entire spectrum of the society. The only question it asked is, is the material copper or brass?

An appropriate analogy to illustrate the communal contributions of this practice would be that of an alarm clock.

Just as an alarm clocks alerts us about the time, the kalaiwalas’ call served a similar role but on a regional scale. His call was a periodic reminder for people to inspect their utensils and ensure that their health was not at risk. This brought about a sense of interdependence between the community and the artisan, each looking out for themselves by looking out for each other. Also, kalai, being a physically intense and time-consuming yet extremely fascinating process, served as a sweet excuse for the women and children of the neighbourhood to gather, chat and play while being curious spectators and quality monitors.

The art of kalai responded to the aspects of sustenance at various levels. Firstly, the practice required simple materials that were not exclusive to any zone, climate or source, making the procurement of ingredients fairly easy. Secondly, by employing itself on materials that had high-conductivity, it helped harness the full potential of the fuel, being sensitive in turn to the environment as well as the physical labour that went into collecting the firewood. Thirdly, by averting corrosion of the metal, the kitchenware lasted for decades without having their quality and strength compromised. This is drastically different from the vicious loop in which customers find themselves at present – that of – buying often and discarding often.  At the time, household objects were treated as investments and cultural practices like kalai, added to their longevity as well as value. Unfortunately, this no longer holds true.

It is evident that kalai and the kalai-wala remain relevant only as long as the society uses kitchenware made of copper and brass. Sadly, by the end of the 20th century, the newly minted republic of India leaned increasingly towards industrialization. And with this shift, the colour of an Indian kitchen changed from golds to greys. Aluminium and stainless steel came to represent the quintessential idea of a ‘modern’ home. ‘The allure of the ‘ever-silver’ aesthetic was strong enough to overshadow the fact that stainless steel neither conducted heat as well as copper nor retained heat as well as brass or cast iron. Yet, its easy maintenance was too compelling to ignore.’ [8]

This leaves us at a fascinating juncture. On a positive note, the aforementioned case helps us understand the aspects that we, as a community, appreciate and aspire for; on the other hand, it throws light on the costs that we, as a community, are willing to pay for ease and aesthetic.  

A recent increase in awareness about the benefits associated with copper and brass has revived their use in part. While this new found awareness may be a step in the right direction, conversations circumventing the ills associated with their continued use are still lacking within the colloquial.  In the process of creating awareness about a subject, critical examination of the craft – its practice and not just the product is often left off the table, which leaves room for misinterpretation and missed opportunities. For instance, when the popular article cited in this essay applauds the artisans’ grit when working with grey-white opaque smoke, there must be space for concern and mitigation as much as appreciation.

‘Mohammad Zeeshan claims that the fumes of the nausadar powder are not hazardous to health citing the health of his father and grandfather as examples. “Though as a precaution, our grandfather has instructed us to eat gud (jaggery) after work, a gharelu nuska (household remedy) to keep the lungs clean”, he states as a matter of fact.’ [8] Doctors with pulmonary expertise might disagree. It has also been noted that the vessel reaches a temperature of around 600oC – what precautions have been put in place to address that risk?

Before we proceed, we must go back to the first image and the impressions that came with it.  The art of kalai is dying, simply because its relevance has been ignored when focus shifted to convenience. Ironically, this convenience has come with the hidden fee of hefty medical bills, which if acknowledged and investigated may prompt a return to bronze-hued kitchens.

Copper and brass utensils augmented by kalai protect and heal our body, our health, our investments and even our resources. They also have, for millennia, brought the community together. Modern design practices and designers should help kalaiwalas to interpret their craft for a modern consumer, and also work towards finding safer ways of practicing this craft.

Another learning is; adapt, not revert. Our education should equip us to empower these communities and involve them in our processes, instead of simply deferring current ‘solutions’ as a reaction to their forced irrelevance for years.

All these learnings should motivate us to stop and re-evaluate our preferences and priorities. We must re-visit and re-learn the beauty that lies in the simplicity of these practices. And most importantly, return to designing solutions that benefit people instead of a person. These practices prompt us to view design like silk, painfully delicate yet surprisingly strong.

The pungent fumes in the work place evince the downside of this work, the disturbing unnatural greened nails of the workers. The constant contact with acid, soda and these substances has the cording, roughening effect on the skin of their hands and their fingernails bear alarming testimony to the nature of their tasks. Such are the perilous hazards of this simple piece of work.

However Haaji Nawabu is positive on the future of this trade though he admits that no one would want to take it up in the face of the negative effects, but if these are handled or done way with, maybe the process, if not modernized a bit cleansed for the workers, the health benefit, as promulgated by men of medicine, is sure to make it popular and expand the business. It is an intricate and beautiful little craft, worthy of protection.

On our pursuit to explore this distinct artistic work we reached out to Eram Sabi, a resident of the old city. After being asked about the different facets of this dying artistic work she says, “We still visit the Hakim in our area and his diagnosis and remedies always work. It was on his recommendation that we started using a copper jug for water. The kalai process employs Nausadar that is very good for digestion. So even in modern times we like to abide by these old world cures that are so easy and efficient”.

Copper itself has many amazing benefits to offer. It has anti-microbial properties. Drinking water from a copper container is especially recommended. Skin disease such as vitiligo is combated by stimulated melanin production, aging can be reduced by the production of collagen, a connecting tissue, and anemia caused due to copper deficiency is also helped. But excess consumption can also be harmful to liver as balanced is beneficial to it, so one may consult a doctor before using copper utensils.

If we still continue to ignore all such artisan and their craftsmanship no doubt the art and science of Kalai and other fascinating art form of our childhood days might become extinct. So what we need to do is that we should utilize their traditional skills in new ways to generate fresh ideas and eye catching new products.

The house functioned like a well-oiled machine in those days with my Ba/Dadi at the helm of it all. Those were the days when the material pleasures weren’t in abundance nonetheless life was filled with immense joy and happiness. Life seemed to revolve around school, play and food. The air bustled with one or the other chore related to the food we were either stocking oil cans, getting the spices prepped and hand pounded, there were stacks of wheat-filled gunny bags almost 1000 kilos of it to feed our clan; wheat that had to be handpicked for impurities and coated with castor oil for the year-long storage, 13-14 varieties of pickles were made annually in summers so we were all snacking on raw mangoes, the winters had papad and wadi making sessions, potato wafers happened when new potatoes arrived in the markets. Then there were numerous other jobs like working with Saraniyaa to get the knives sharpened and get the brassware re-tinned. I remember requesting Ba to get the Kalai job done when we were home. Kalai is when we saw the magic happen, the dark and soiled looking brass pots and pans would magically turn shiny like new. Ba would always oblige and we would be part of that 2 hours of Kalai show. The workstation was set up under the Chikoo tree in our front yard. The brassware was brought in, the price negotiated and Ba would set-up her chair to monitor the entire process. Kalai is the process where brass and copper utensils used for cooking and eating are coated with a metal called Kalai. The Kalai coating fades with use and needs to be re-tinned after 6-8 months of usage. Brass and copper tend to react to souring agents in food and thus giving them a Kalai lining is a must.
Brass vessels were used for everyday cooking and eating in our family. It was a lot of hassle to keep them shiny every day. The ritual involving thorough cleaning was limited to twice-thrice a year when stored rainwater was used to wash the tamarind scrubbed vessels. Each vessel was dried thoroughly and allowed to soak in tender rays of pleasant winter sun. Summers were never meant for such tedious works. Gradually, with time we started stacking the brassware in lofts and trunks as steel and aluminium made way in the kitchen for the sheer ease it was to clean and maintain these utensils. As the use of brass decreased the need to call in the kalaiwala also decreased. Little did we realize that such lifestyle changes would drastically impair the livelihoods of our service providers. Once a regular ritual of witnessing the magic of Kalai was reduced to one every couple of years until it stopped completely. The Kalaiwala like many other traditional professions became a forgotten professional of a vanishing occupation.
The journey of writing this blog gives me the much-needed opportunities to visit and understand the fading practices related to our kitchens be it the way we grow food, prepare food, cook food and all the peripheral things associated with food. As the wisdom to go back to the traditional practices prevails I was required to call kalaiwala to re-tin the brass inheritance I possess.
Jagdishbhai is 5th generation Kalaiwala, who has been practising this craft for more than 45 years. I prefer to call all these traditional professions crafts because of the dextrous skills they require. Jagadishbhai learnt his craft from his father however his children have not taken up this profession hence he is the last amongst his generation to practice this craft. Working under the open sky in scorching 45 degrees C is a challenging task but he chose to do it with a smile on his face. The cost of raw materials nausadar (ammonium chloride) and Kalai have both become gone up in recent times. Kalai reaches India from Afghanistan where they have mines of this metal. Although the awareness on the use of brass, copper and Kansa is on the rise the profession is dying a slow death and isn’t enticing the younger generations. Jagdhishbhai talked at length about the benefits of using, brass that wears a kalai coated, hope and optimism about the rise of this occupation in coming times!!

The city of Lucknow is known for its fine perfumes that are available in beautiful bottles of cut-glass work. Perfumers in Lucknow make delicate and lasting fragrances using various aromatic herbs, spices, sandal oil, musk, essence of flowers, and leaves. Attar, derived from Persian word 'atr' means fragrance. Perfumes or attars have been in use in Lucknow since the 19th century. During the days of the nawabs, perfumes were also added to food to enhance the taste and aroma of the dish. It is said that Mughal empress, Nur Jahan, would bathe in water perfumed by rose water, thus encouraging people to start extracting scented oil from the flower. 

Legend has it that the practice of using natural substances to derive scents came from ascetics who would burn roots and other plant material during their meditative bonfires. The sweet smells lingered for a while, inspiring nearby villagers to experiment with flowers to find the right tones. Once they had attars down to a science, the villagers started presenting these fragrances to the nawabs, who would spray the halls and walkways of the palaces before the arrival of guests. Since attar also has therapeutic properties, when sprayed in public spaces, it would subtly put visitors at ease.  

Unlike their synthetic counterparts, attars are meant to be applied directly to the skin, and last much longer. They are organic in nature, and therefore more sustainable than artificial scents. You can pick traditional and famous fragrances like khus, keora, chameli, zafran and agar from the markets in Aminabad or Chowk.

It is a 3-day event that celebrates creativity in all its forms. It is held each year in Lucknow, during the month of February/March, and celebrates excellence in Indian and International writing.[2]

The Lucknow Literary Festival too confers "Pride of Lucknow"[4] award and "Wajid Ali Shah"[5] award, which are given to people who have been contributing extraordinarily in different spheres of life. These people may belong to various fields like Hindi writing, Urdu writing, Journalism, Social service etc. These eminent personalities belong to Lucknow and even across India respectively.

Lucknow, the city renowned for its adaa and tehzeeb has nurtured some of the finest personalities, most of whom went on to make a name globally. Some, however, continued to be unsung heroes working behind the scenes to carve their niche. Lucknow Society in its third edition of the Lucknow Literary Festival 2015 bestowed four eminent personalities with awards for excellence in their respective field. These awardees belong to Lucknow or have some kind of association with the city and brought it glory. They might have migrated to other parts of the globe but nevertheless they remain proud possessions of Lucknow and both city and they are proud to be a Lucknowite. Though the award is just another number for them as they have already been conferred with numerous accolades previously, nevertheless we hope it boosts their enthusiasm and serves as a token of appreciation for them.

Lucknow Literary Festival bestowed Wajid Ali Shah award to legendary Kathak exponent Pandit Birju Maharaj. Named after last Nawab of Lucknow, the award was bestowed to Maharaj ji as he has made a great contribution in order to keep the art alive. He was born as Brijmohan Mishra to a noted Kathak exponent, Jagannath Maharaj, popularly known as Acchan Maharaj. His father served as a court dancer in Raigarh princely state. Trained by his uncles, Lachhu Maharaj and Shambhu Maharaj and his father, Birju Maharaj exhibited his talent at the tender age of seven and became a legend in the Lucknow gharana of Kathak dance. Credit goes to him for taking kathak to its previously unattained zenith. Pandit Birju Maharaj served as the director of the Kathak Kala Kendra for several years. He took to teaching kathak at a very young age and later founded his own dance school, Kalashram which imparts training to aspiring dancers. Though kathak remains his first love, very few know that he is trained in Hindustani classical music too. He has composed the music, and sang, for two dance sequences in the Satyajit Ray’s Shatranj ke Khilari, and choreographed the song Kaahe Chhed Mohe from the 2002 film version of movie Devdas. The Government of India conferred on him the Padma Vibhushan Award, Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and the Kalidas Samman. In 2012, he was bestowed with the National Award for Best Choreography for the film Vishwaroopam.

The Lucknow Literary Festival and so its audience was indeed fortunate to have been graced by Pandit Birju Maharaj. The presentation screen at the festival showcasing old video clips, which showed him dancing and imparting kathak lessons to audience evoked a sense of nostalgia and pride among his fans. In the heart-to-heart interaction with the audience, Pandit Birju Maharaj said he was overjoyed to have won the award. He also expressed his desire for the revamping of his old ancestral home Kalka Bindadin Maharaj ji ki Dyodhi at Lucknow into a heritage spot. It is relevant to mention here that the government of Uttar Pradesh has ordered a grant for the restoration of his ancestral property in Lucknow. Pandit Birju Maharaj wishes to establish a kathak training school at his ancestral home with due support from the government. He also expressed concern at the eroding tehzeeb in Lucknow and stressed the need to revive performing arts in the city.

Besides Wajid Ali Shah award, the Pride of Lucknow awards were conferred on three distinguished luminaries.

Shiv Murti - Pride Of Lucknow Award

The Pride of Lucknow award for the contribution to Hindi literature was bestowed on author Shiv Murti. Born on March 11, 1950, Shiv Murti is one of the leading voices in contemporary Hindi fiction. Hailing from humble background, his life was full of struggle. But the best steel is made when iron is passed in hottest temperature. This holds true for author Shiv Murti. A person of few words, he let his works do the talking for him. His first story ‘Mujhe Jeena Hai’ followed by ‘Paanphool’ was published when he was studying in 12th standard. Thereafter he never looked back. His works depict the plight of rural folk in true light. Caste politics, power politics, poverty and Dalit problems form the theme of his works. One of his best novels ‘Triyacharitra’ portrays the life of a young girl who is false implicated for having an illicit relationship and as a consequence has to bear the brutal punishment handed out by gram panchayat. This novel was later made into a movie by Basu Chatterjee. Since his works paint a picture of rural life in true fervor, his fans consider him as second Premchand. But he brushes aside this compliment saying: “Premchand is Premchand. I can never replace him.” His other novels are Trishul and Tarpan. Keshar Kasturi is a collection of stories authored by him. Now his fans should gear up for the re- release of his novel ‘Akhiri Chhalang’. Shivmurti has won Kathakram and Hans award in the past. Though he is satisfied with the kind of Hindi works produced today, he expresses concern at the youngsters losing interest in Hindi literature.

Madhvi Kuckreja - Pride Of Lucknow Award

The Pride of Lucknow award for excellence in women empowerment was bestowed on Madhvi Kuckreja, a social worker and founder of NGO Vanaangan. Humbled to receive the award, she considers herself fortunate to have won it though she had shifted her base to Lucknow only few years back. She has set up a shop, Sanatkada here that sells handicrafts, functions as a café, a book club and a film club, all rolled into one. Madhvi has supported numerous women-led, grassroots-level organizations to emerge as transparent, vibrant entities that are sensitive to women. Internationally, she has worked on building opinion against women being subjected to violence in Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka and Sudan. Before moving to Lucknow, she was earlier working in Bundelkhand for alleviating the problems of Dalit women, who are entangled in triad of poverty, caste discrimination and gender subjugation. Though they have been financially independent for long, Dalit women are subjected to discrimination and violence in all forms manifesting itself through rape, public humiliation, or honor killings. Another common punishment for breaking community rules that is also used simply for vengeance is public stripping and parading of women. Violence can also take an extreme form with lynching of women labeled as witches or dayans. Domestic violence however, cuts through religious, caste and class boundaries-dowry related death caused by “accidental” burning of women thrives in the state. Moreover, when women gain property rights-usually after being widowed-they become targets of violence by members of the family or community. Therefore, instead of being economically empowering, property is itself a reason for violence against women. She expresses satisfaction that Due to the collective efforts of her NGO, knowledge levels among Dalit women have increased and they are assuming leadership roles in the village community.

Anis Ashfaq - Pride Of Lucknow Award

The third Pride of Lucknow award was conferred on noted Urdu author Anees Ashfaq. His work ‘Dukhyare’ highlighting his close relationship with elder brother carries the undertones of declining affluent culture of Lucknow. Elated though to receive the award, he considers ‘Qalam’ as his biggest award. “My writings are useless until they fail to strike a chord with genuine readers,” he said on his felicitation. So what make him pursue writing in Urdu? “I was an avid reader at the age of 18-19. Credit goes to my mother for imparting me lessons in Urdu and shaping my language as it is today.” He expresses concern at the declining habit of reading in today’s youngsters and their overriding ambitions to become stars overnight. He, however, lauds the initiative of Lucknow Society and stresses such rendezvous should be encouraged as they serve as a platform to bring genuine writers together and instills awareness among people. His writings reflect genuine critical analysis of the contemporary scenario. He believes that writings on Lucknow today are not portraying it in true light. With his desire for cultural revival of the city, his upcoming next novel is also set in Lucknow.

With conferring of these four awards, honouring of the dignitaries at the festival came to an end. We at Lucknow Society are thrilled to award best of talent in the city and will continue to reward blossoming excellence in the years to come.




MARSIYA AND MANASAVI:


Marsiya and Masnavi:  Beyond ghazals, Lucknow was known for its marsiya (elegies) commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Hussain and his companions

Mir Babbar Ali Anees popularly known as ‘Shayar-e Azam’ is the king of marsiya, or elegy in Urdu poetry. Along with his contemporary, Mirza Salamat Ali Dabir, his style of writing the marsiya reached its zenith in Lucknow.

Marsiya is a poetic form focused on the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain in the seventh century along with 72 companions in the Battle of Karbala in modern day Iraq.

Mir-Anees-Stamp

Anees was a born poet and his talent for poetry was inherited by him from his grandfather, Mir Hasan, a celebrated poet of the masnavi style. His father Mir Khaliq was also a poet and Anees was very proud of his poetic ancestry.

Anees started writing ghazals in Faizabad where he was born under the pseudonym Hazin, or treasurer but in Lucknow he changed his name to Anees.

This takhallus, or pseudonym is said to be a gift from Iman Baksh Nasikh, a great composer of ghazal who died in Lucknow in 1838 when Anees was in his mid 30s. Nasikh had predicted a bright future for Anees and his charming style of reciting verse.

His contribution to Urdu language is tremendous, for Anees is responsible for polishing and refining the language and filling his compositions with remarkable sweetness, elegance and freshness.

The vocabulary at his command was vast and he used words with great thought and grace. He added many new words.

Pure Urdu
The Urdu of Anees is considered authoritative by scholars from Lucknow and Delhi and his family was aptly called the custodian of the pure Urdu idiom. Anees provides an epic element to Urdu literature. He perfected the old theme and added new ones in the marsiya he wrote. He was a master painter of scenes of nature in all its moods. These descriptions of nature are not independent but always immersed into the main theme by the poet. Anees was a master of understanding and capturing human emotions and interpreting them into verse. Feelings of joy and sorrow, anger, love, jealously, envy, fear, are all portrayed in a superb style by him that is very moving.

The description of battle-fields, fights, marches, counter- marches, challenges, the weapons used are brought to life, leaving a very vivid and powerful impression on the reader. For his kind of writing, Anees enjoyed an enviable reputation during his lifetime as well and which remains unchallenged to this day.

India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru always read Anees on the 10th day of Mohurram throughout his life. According to Shibli Nomani, Islamic scholar from the early 20th century, no other poet has such a lush vocabulary at his command as Anees, including poets writing in other languages apart from Urdu. That is why his rich poetic qualities remain unmatched by any other poet.

Josh Malihabadi, famous Urdu poet who died in 1982, pays rich tribute to Anees in verse:

“Teri Har Mauj-e Nafas Rooh-ul Ameen Ki Jaan Hai, Tu Meri Urdu Zubaan Ka Bolta Quran Hai”

The fame of Anees continues to rise as more people get interested in Urdu literature. According to Shamsur Rahman Faruqi, poet and leading Urdu critic and theorist, the marsiya of Anees is the best example of narrative-historical, narrative-lyrical, and oral-dramatic poetry in pre-modern Urdu. Dr Sharib Rudaulvi, retired professor, Centre of Indian Languages, Jawaharlal Nehru University adds that the poetry of Anees is a glowing representation of the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb of Lucknow.

“Khana Hai, Na Peena Hai, Na Rahat Hai, Na Sona Hai, Hai Khaakh Ka Farsh Aur, Na Takiya Na Bichona Hai”

Anees did not leave Lucknow till the takeover of Avadh by the British in 1856. He felt that his art would not be appreciated outside Lucknow but circumstances forced him to earn a living elsewhere. In 1859, and again in 1860 he went to Patna. He transited in Varanasi on his return after the second journey. He visited Hyderabad in 1871 and stopped at Allahabad to recite his marsia in the Imambara of Lala Beni Prasad Srivastava who was a devotee of Hazrat Imam Hussain before an audience of thousands. Whenever Anees recited in Lucknow, large crowds of people would collect to hear him.

Anees died in Lucknow in 1874 and lies buried near his house in a locality known as ‘Kucha-e Mir Annes’ in the old city.

India is not only a melting pot but a salad brawl, which manifests equally in grief and sorrow. The Muharram is the one that is being observed with religious-cultural ethos. Many traditions and customs that enriched India today have come from Persia during the Mughal era – some also before it – giving birth to the observations such as Taziyadari and Marsiyakhwani, making the country a synthesis of culture.

Marsiyakhwani, the meaning, and the background

The term Marsiya is a derivative of the Arabic ‘Risa’, which means praising the dead in a funeral oration, weeping and wailing over the deceased. Marsiya, generally speaking, is an elegy recited to express sorrow on the death of a person. But it has been symbolized by the commemoration of the martyrdom of Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) grandson, Imam Hussain. The form of Urdu Marsiya is only related to this only as it has been observed in the Indian subcontinent but now it is recited across the world. Imam Hussain and His family including his 6-month-old son were martyred in the month of Muharram, Marsiya used to be mainly recited by Shia Muslims only. Other sects of the Muslim community and even Hindu poets also adopted this form of Marsiya in their poetry.

Marsiya evolved in two different techniques; one is Tahtul Lafz means in spoken form without the use of musical notes like Sa Re Ga Ma. The legendary Marsiyakhwan who made this art famous, Mir Anees recited Tahtul Lafz Marsiya in which he used his hands to express the particular event. Another form started gaining popularity in Majalis (mourning ceremonies) which were recited by the people with good soulful voices i.e. Sozkhwani.

Marsiya was a Persian literary tradition, it molded with its uniqueness in India when many Persian poets and scholars came here. Marsiya first developed in the Deccan as a form of folk poetry. As an audience-oriented literary tradition it changed following the social environment and patronage patterns, and in this process absorbed many traits of oral epic rendition. The theatrical arts of Indian and Persian origin also influenced it considerably, and thus Marsiya represented the synthesis of multiple cultural traditions. It assimilated the traits of both classical canonized forms and folk musical varieties and developed from Khwanandagi (chanting) into a most sophisticated musical style – the Sozkhwani.

Marsiya as a well-defined literary form existed in Arabic literature in pre-Islamic days (Daur-i Jahili) and many poets such as Muhalhil Taghlabi (c. 531 AD) and Khamsa shaira (44 A.H.) contributed to the ‘Risa’ poetry. However, this tradition is much older in Iran and may be traced to the literary and musical conventions of pre-Islamic ancient Persia. Sog-i Siyawash (mourning of Siyawash, Cyrus, the father of Kai Khusrau) and Marg-i Zarir (the death of Zarir, brother of Gushtasp) figure most in the tales (asatir) of bygone days. Some stories (dastan) and poetic verses are still extant in Pahlavi, reminiscent of the legacy of the ancient Persians. Sog-i Siyawashan is a famous melody (ahang) of a sombre nature that prompts us to cry.

Marsiya in Urdu was first written in the 16th century in South India, in the kingdoms of Golconda and Bijapur which were Shiite kingdoms. This form found an especially congenial soil in Lucknow, an important Shia Muslim community in the Indian subcontinent, where it was regarded as an act of piety and religious duty to eulogize and bemoan the martyrs of the battle of Karbala. The genre was championed by Mir Babar Ali Anees.

Talking to India News Stream about this art, famous Marsiyakhwan of Lucknow and Urdu litterateur Qazi Asad said, “The Art of Tahtul Lafz Marsiya Khwani is the recitation of Urdu Epics & Elegies based on the Tragedy of Imam Hussain in Karbala in a Declaratory form with the obvious usage of voice, eyes, hands, etc. to let the audience understand and feel different emotions of every Stanza of the Elegy which is mostly comprised of six verses.”

Fundamentals of Marsiyakhwani

Marsiya generally consists of six-line units, with a rhyming quatrain, and a couplet on a different rhyme.

It is characterized by six-line verses in an AA, AA, and BB rhyme scheme. They are traditionally either recited by Marsiya-Khwans or sung by a Sozkhwan.

Historian Rana Safvi writes in her blog, “A classical Urdu Marsiya usually includes most of the following sections: a prelude (Chehrah) of poems of praise, descriptions of the morning or night before the battle, a general introduction to the hardships faced by Hussein; a description of the poem’s hero — whether Hussein or one of his companions — and his virtues; the leave-taking or departure for the battlefield (Rukhsat); the entry onto the field (Aamad); a declaration of the hero’s martial prowess (Rajaz); the battle (Jang); the martyrdom (Shahadat); and finally, the lament (Bain). To this one could add the topical focus (Maajrah) and the prayer (Dua).”

Famous marsiya writers in Urdu include Mir Babar Ali Anis, Mirza Salamat Ali Dabeer, Ali Haider Tabatabai, Najm Afandi, Josh Malihabadi, and others. Well-known Persian poets of the genre include Muhtasham Kashani, Nawab Ahmad Ali Khan Qayamat, and Samet Borujerdi. In Turkish, Bâkî composed an important Marsiya.

Mir Babar Ali Anes, a renowned Urdu poet, composed salāms, elegies, Nauhas, and quatrains. While the length of the elegy initially had no more than forty or fifty stanzas, he pushed it beyond one hundred fifty or even longer than two hundred stanzas or bands, as each unit of Marsiya in the ‘Musaddas’(six liners) format is known. Mir Anees drew upon the vocabulary of Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Hindi, and Awadhi to a great degree. He has become an essential element of Muharram among the Urdu speakers of the Indian subcontinent. The first major and still current critical articulation about Mir Anis was Muazna-e-Anis-o-Dabir (1907) written by Shibli Nomani in which he said “the poetic qualities and merits of Anis are not matched by any other poet”.

Another important Marsiya poet was Chhannu Lal Dilgeer who was born during the reign of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah. He was initially a ghazal poet with the ‘takhallus’ (pen name) ‘Tarab’, before focusing on Marsiya at a later stage. He converted to Islam and changed his name to Ghulam Hussain. His most popular marsiya is ‘Ghabrayegi Zainab’, which is currently being recited in houses during Ashura i.e. 10th Muharram.




OPEN MICS IN LUCKNOW:


Open mics in lucknow are occupying good space on the events calendar in Lucknow. As a multi-cultural city, Lucknow was always the culture capital of India ever since the era of the Kings and the Nawabs. Music, dance and poetry (sher-o-shayari) reached their peak under royal patronage. Even today, Lucknow occupies an important place as the center for music, poetry, plays, dance and design among many other things. It comes as no surprise that Lucknowites take immense pride in the city’s cultural legacy.

But as the society progressed, people began to move away from art and literature towards the modern entertainment avenues. The traditional literary art forms have faced a lot of neglect in the past but it is due to their unbeatable charm that they seem to have gotten a new lease of life. Albeit slowly, but Lucknow and its people have embraced the growing trend of open mic sessions, which have become a regular feature in the evolving café culture in the city.

These events are focused on performing arts like poetry, spoken word, music and stand-up comedy and bring together professionals and amateur talent with an audience that is willing to accept and listen. In Lucknow, there was never a dearth of gifted individuals but what it lacked was suitable platforms, which forced people to move out to the bigger cities, in search of a stage that would allow them to showcase their talent.

Open mics in Lucknow and the Impact
Open mics in Lucknow encourage people from different walks of life share their original work or even the work of their favourite authors and poets. Not everyone who writes is comfortable performing in public but being in the company of a like-minded, warm and unbiased audience often acts as a catalyst to encourage people to write more.

The beauty of open-mics lies in the fact that no session can be re-created. Every session is unique in its way and thus the audience can expect something different in every event. A lot of places that organise these open-mics usually follow a theme, which provides different perspectives to a topic. They create a social space where performers are able to polish their skills and individuals, especially youngsters are encouraged to express themselves through writing and poetry. To add to it, the laid back and serene atmosphere serves as the perfect setting to inspire creativity.

It is not just the cafes and performers that have benefitted from the growing open mic culture. Organisers as young as school students are seen arranging various sessions of open mics on a weekly basis. This not only inculcates creativity, responsibility and appreciation for art but also hones their skills and personality.

In Lucknow, there are many groups dedicated to reviving the poetry and literature culture in the city by organising regular open-mics. Some of them are:

Mukhaatib Foundation:
Mukhaatib is a poetry group that welcomes those who share their passion for Urdu literature and poetry. They routinely organise poetic evenings / mushairas in the presence of famous Urdu poets of Lucknow, and organise workshops & open mics for the youth / new and budding poets of the city. Their workshops include the basics of Urdu language, classification of Urdu poetry and the basics of Urdu Ghazal. There is even a question-answer round to clarify any doubts or queries on the nuances and finer aspects or Urdu poetry.

The Poetry Club, Lucknow:
The Poetry Club (TPC) is a community that gives budding poets and writers a chance to connect with others who share their love for words. Regarded as one of the best open mics in Lucknow, they provide a comfortable and warm setting for literature lovers to exchange poetry and showcase their work.

The Writer’s Hub:
The Writer’s Hub believes that writing is a medium to emote our thoughts, emotions and imagination. Welcoming writers from all across, their motto is “You write, We Share.” They regularly hold open mics in Lucknow and organise workshops to help young talent find the way in the mesmerizing world of literature.

Literature and poetry are not just art forms. Open Mics in Lucknow showcase the cultural significance and are a part of the identity that the city holds today. One major reason for the decline of the literary art is the fading interest of the new generation. Thus, it becomes all the important to hold such open mic events in Lucknow where youngsters are encouraged to explore accept their culture so that art is not only preserved but revived to its former glory. 




REPERTWAHR FESTIVAL:


Conceived in 2009, Repertwahr started life as a small theatre festival in the city of Lucknow. It was the coming together of a few passionate individuals who wanted to change the face of Lucknow theatre of the time.

Helmed by Bhoopesh Rai and Priyanka Sarkar, the festival soon gained a steady following amongst the theatre and art lovers of the city. The festival kept surpassing its own benchmarks, year after year. It soon added Music and Stand-up comedy to its performance genres amidst a stupendous response from the starved-for-quality-content audience of Lucknow.

The quality of its content, the vibrant, festive ambiance and the seamless execution of the festival has led to the Repertwahr festival blossoming into one of India's most unique celebrations of performing arts.

Over the years, Repertwahr has organically evolved into a crack production team that hosts niche events, produces awesome video content and runs clutter -breaking campaigns for its clients.

Bhoopesh and Priyanka are also the founder trustees of the Repertwahr Foundation, which has been working to promote performing arts in general and theatre in particular, in the smaller towns of the country, with a special focus on the state of Uttar Pradesh.

Repertwahr Festival is one of the most unique Lucknow theatre festival which actively promotes music, films and theatre in Lucknow featuring best talents.

This was long overdue. And yes we have kept you waiting long enough. But as they say, better late than never, here we are. It fills us with immense pride and no small amount of anxiety as we put together the 8th season of the celebration that is The Repertwahr Festival. With the Repertwahr blog, we hope to start a dialogue with you and provide you with the inside scoop on the festival, the team behind it and the performances that are in store for you this season.

Started in the year 2009, The Repertwahr Festival has set its own benchmarks, year after year. From its humble beginnings, the festival has grown up to be the most marquee festival on the city’s cultural calendar. Every year, we bring together some of India’s biggest and the best performing artists under one roof to make it a week-long celebration of art unlike any other.

Repertwahr Festival was born out of a zeal to change the way art is perceived in the city. A team of like-minded friends came together and put up a 5-day Theatre Festival in Lucknow, hoping against hope to that the city is going to appreciate their efforts. The very first day was heartbreaking as a total of 50 people turned up to watch our very first show. But before we could lose our faith, the word spread about the festival and our 3rd show became houseful. The rest, as they say, is history.

We haven’t looked back since. Over the course of last 7 years, Repertwahr Festival has grown to become one of the biggest theatre & music festivals in India. Last year we hosted more than 150 artists from all over the country to perform in front of our appreciative audience. Till date, Repertwahr has hosted 78 super successful shows featuring some of India’s biggest, brightest talents on stage.

The soulful evenings turn social before and after every performance. The team works really hard to make the audience experience as seamless, festive and artistic as we possibly can. The fest mirrors the tireless efforts of the team right from the entrance of the location, the decor, the ambience and the lineup of artists on stage.

In 2014, Repertwahr first dabbled in music as a performance genre. It debuted with a single Manganiyar troupe presenting their folksy tunes while the audience waited for the theatre show to start. Now, 20 amazing shows later, Repertwahr’s music stage commands a following of its own.




ZARBULAND WORK:


The charm and richness of the heritage of the historic city of Lucknow have been the characteristic of the city since ages. The royal culture, cuisine and craft, all deserve a special mention for being the highlight of the city. During all these years, Lucknow has not only carried the lineage forward but has also accepted newer things with open arms.

Bidri is one such craft that has its roots of origination in the state of Karnataka but now it is an inherent art form practiced widely in Lucknow. The city provided the art form with a flourishing ground with many local craftsmen who readily adopted the unique form of craft in their works. Bidri work supports the livelihood of hundreds of craftsmen today and is an integral part of the city’s art and craft culture.

Lucknow and its relation with the craft

Lucknow city has always been an ardent promoter of craft be it the Chikankari, Zardozi or Bidriware and Zarbuland. The art form found a foothold in the city during the rule of the Nawabs. The Nawabs were fond of the craft and supported it which eventually resulted in the setting up of various centres of the art form. In fact Zarbuland, which is a variant of Bidriware, got more prominence in the city of Nawabs. Today you can easily find Bidri and Zarbuland work on trays, bowls, hookah base (Huqqah Farshi), jewel boxes, cigarette holders and many other decorative articles as well. The art that was encouraged decades ago by the Nawabs of Awadh, is now an important feature of the city, and forms a vital part of the livelihood of many local artisans.

What exactly is Bidriware?

Bidriware got its name after the place of its origination which is Bidar in Karnataka. The craft was introduced in India by the Bahamani Sultans and is believed to have been traditionally invented in Persia several centuries ago. Bidriware includes damascening which is the craft of coating one metal with another through undercutting and hammering. The process is difficult and intricate but the finished product is beautiful, full of sheen and shine.

The gleam, which Bidriware has, is its highlight as it is done on the lustrous surface of the shiny metals, including the silver inlaying. A Bidriware goes through the long process of molding, polishing, carving, inlaying and darkening of the alloy to jet black for the silver design to look more appealing. The process includes use of mixture of copper and zinc in the ratio of 1:16 along with other non-ferrous metals that don’t rust on exposure to moisture. The designs are inlaid with fine wires or strips of silver that look beautiful in contrast against the black surface of the Bidriware.

Zarbuland actually looks similar to the Tanjore metal work plates with certain differences.

ZARDOZI WORK:


Zardozi is a fascinating form of embroidery work that originated under the influence of Mughal Kings in the Kingdom of Oudh, currently identified as the central part of Uttar Pradesh in India. A large number of artisans engaging in Zardozi or Chikankari are employed in the trade of developing beautiful embroidery on a variety of textile material.

Zardozi and Chikankari are among the most iconic forms of embroidery that continue to represent Lucknow City on the World fashion map. A renowned scholar on Arts and Culture once said, “Hand occupies only second place after brain in terms of cultural evolution.” To this date, handmade artifacts are sole witnesses that teach us about the cultural evolution of human civilization. As time progressed, each of the art forms that employed handiwork became sole representatives of the indigenous cultures. It is through these art forms that we are usually introduced to these cultures by virtue of these handmade artifacts.

However, while Zardozi continues to wow the world of owing to its exquisite and brilliant feel, the very hands that create this magic find themselves struggling for a decent livelihood today. Men and Women behind this centuries old fine craft unfortunately, haven’t even got the recognition they deserved. As a result, the newer generations are shying away from getting into the hereditary trade as they call it.

Zardozi artists even since Mughal period have committed themselves and their generations to keep this precious art alive. Today, they feel they are denied their rights to be a part of mainstream owing to the economic status, which again stems from the unfair working conditions as well as miniscule wages that they receive as their remuneration for dedicating their lives. What is even more remorseful is the apathy that these artisans face from all quarters be it industrialists, businessmen, or political leaders.

A wonderful movie on the state of Zardozi artisan community has been produced by FEED (Federation of Education and Economic Development).

This movie seeks to find and address ground root level situation of Zardozi workers in Lucknow City.

While the Government of India has always been pretty active towards the cause of recognition and upliftment of handicrafts of India, Zardozi workers somehow have always felt short in receiving the benefits extended to them. Officials and retailers often attribute this trend to the laid-back attitude of these artisans, however that is rather a partial observation.

In cultural terms, community of Zardozi artisans has always comprised highly self-reliant, and motivated individuals who love their trade as much as their self-esteem. There has always been a tendency among the artists to stay aloof from the worldliness and remain committed to their work. Zardozi artisans too like any other artist community know their worth, and thus do not indulge into securing their livelihood through lobbying or staging sit-ins.

Any related governing bodies must ensure that approaching any artist community must be a task well guided by intent as well as respect for them as well as their craft. It is only then that the state of that craft will heal. Another discouraging fact is that this disgruntled community of Zardozi artisans is often exploited by their local politicians at the times of elections for legislative houses and assemblies. Lack of education as well as lack of well-deserved facilities paves the way for them to be misled by those promising them the moon they have always craved for.

Sadly enough, the problem faced by Zardozi artists exceeds the number of one. In fact, the issues faced can be categorized separately, indicating that in order to uplift the state of Zardozi workmanship, much more than a relief package is required.

The process of developing Zardozi embroidery, involves mounting of the textile material onto a wooden frame, usually a feet and half from floor level. The artisans then, equipped with special needles and sequin materials, sit down on the floor surrounding the frame. Usually it is a 12-hour straight schedule for them, which takes a heavy toll on their backbones often culminating in severe orthopaedic disorders.

Besides, poor lighting conditions also take a heavy toll on their eyesight.

Reports say that cases like these have forced some of the best hands at work to retire early enough, thus putting their financial independence under peril.

Zardozi artisans must be covered under occupational hazard initiatives by both Government as well as NGOs. This must include training to adopt safety guidelines as well as ensure healthcare for those adversely affected.

Another issue that Zardozi artisans face regularly comes from within the Zardozi artisan community. Overwhelmed by the artistic ego perhaps and their once legendary status, Zardozi artists are often found lacking in contemporary business practices such as innovation, time line guided deliveries, looking for new opportunities etc.

The State Government, in this case, should provide training and necessary infrastructure for them to understand the business dynamics vis-a-vis their perspectives as well as try to inculcate healthy professional practices among them. This might not only motivate them to bring improvement in their work process, who knows we might also witness fabulous innovations in the design and quality parameters.

Also, as we speak of training and upgrading work processes of Zardozi artisans, we also need to review the remuneration amounts and other amenities as per the current industry standards.

Considering the fact that Zardozi currently finds itself as the most desirable piece of ownership in the ethnic fashion circle for women all around the world, it will be real irony and grave injustice to ignore the hands that produce such a beautiful craft.
