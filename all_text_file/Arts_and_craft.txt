Lucknow, often referred to as the "golden city of the east," exudes an enchanting old-world charm that captivates visitors from far and wide. It is esteemed as one of India's finest cities, boasting a unique culture characterized by emotional warmth, sophistication, courtesy, and a penchant for gracious living. This cultural richness, famously known as "Lucknowi Tehzeeb," is a harmonious blend of traditions from two communities coexisting for centuries, united by a common language - Urdu. The legacy of the Nawabs of Awadh, who nurtured various art forms, including the exquisite Chikan work, has left an indelible mark on Lucknow's cultural landscape. Chikan, a delicate form of hand embroidery, adorns a variety of fabrics with intricate designs, showcasing 36 distinct stitches. Renowned artisans like Ustad Faiyaaz Khan and Hasan Mirza Saheb have contributed to the prominence of Chikan work in Lucknow. Alongside Chikan, Lucknow is celebrated for its Zardozi and Kamdani embroidery, featuring gold and silver threads embellishing sarees, dupattas, and other garments. The city's craftsmanship extends beyond textiles to encompass a plethora of other arts, including exquisite silverware, intricate ivory and bone carvings, fine pottery, and fragrant attars. Lucknow's cultural tapestry is further enriched by its literary and artistic heritage, evidenced by its association with classical dance forms like Kathak and the vibrant Urdu poetry scene. The city's festivals, such as Moharrum, are marked by emotional processions and traditional contests like kite flying, which have been cherished since the days of the Nawabs. Central to Lucknow's cultural identity is its bustling Chowk, a vibrant marketplace that has been a hub of artistic and commercial activity for centuries. Today, as in the past, Chowk continues to embody the essence of Lucknowi culture, serving as a testament to the city's timeless allure and enduring traditions.

In Uttar Pradesh, a rich tradition of art forms has flourished since ancient times, encompassing painting, sculpting, and intricate handcrafting. Painting, dating back to prehistoric eras, has evolved through various periods, including the illustrious Mughal Era, showcasing scenes from hunting, festivals, and the romantic life. Notably, the Mughal style of painting remains a pinnacle of Asian culture, distinguished by its unique presentation and style. The region of Bundelkhand witnessed the zenith of painting during the reconstruction of the temple of Keshav Dev in Mathura, portraying scenes from the life of Lord Krishna. Handicrafts such as Chikankari, delicate hand embroidery practiced predominantly in Lucknow, adorn fabrics like chiffon and silk, while Zardozi embroidery adds a three-dimensional allure. Other crafts, including pottery, metalware, and carpet weaving, are integral to Uttar Pradesh's cultural expression. The state boasts the largest production of brass and copper in India, with renowned centers for pottery in Khurja and Chunar. Gorakhpur is celebrated for its terracotta creations, while Lucknow is famed for its jewellery, enamel work, and ivory carvings. Additionally, the perfumes of Lucknow, crafted since the 19th century, exhibit delicate fragrances derived from aromatic herbs and flowers, adding another layer to the state's rich artistic heritage.


Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh, is renowned for its rich cultural heritage and vibrant markets. One of the most iconic crafts originating from Lucknow is chikankari, a delicate hand embroidery technique. Introduced in the 17th century, chikankari incorporates 36 different stitching techniques, resulting in exquisite designs on fabrics like chiffon, muslin, and silk. This art form, adorned with floral motifs, has become synonymous with Lucknow's identity, with hundreds of retailers offering various chikankari products across the city. Another renowned craft is zardozi, which means gold embroidery in Persian. This luxurious embroidery technique, adorned with gold threads, pearls, beads, and sequins, was historically used to decorate tapestries, garments, and even royal elephants and horses. Lucknow's perfume industry is equally famous, with perfumers creating delicate fragrances using aromatic herbs, spices, and floral essences. These fragrances, known as attars, have been in use since the 19th century and were even added to food during the era of the nawabs to enhance taste and aroma. The tradition of using natural substances to derive scents dates back to ascetics who burned plant material during meditative rituals, inspiring villagers to experiment with flower essences. These attars not only provided aromatic pleasure but also had therapeutic properties, creating a serene ambiance in the palaces of Lucknow. These crafts and industries, deeply rooted in Lucknow's history and culture, continue to thrive, enriching the city's cultural tapestry and attracting visitors from far and wide.
