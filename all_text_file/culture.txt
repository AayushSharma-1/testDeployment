Lucknow was the cradle of the famous Ganga-Yamuni culture. Utterly secular in nature it highlighted fraternity and cordiality among Hindus and Muslims. The focus was on humanity rather than community, The keynote of the prevalent lifestyle was tehzeeb, tameez aur nafaasat (manners, etiquette, and sophistication). The emergence of this cult may be ascribed to the Awadhi Nawabs who attempted to enjoy life to the hilt and looked for perfection in every aspect.
A tour of Lucknow is meaningless without experiencing its gastronomic marvel, the Kebabs. These kebabs have an unending variety, Tunde, Kakori Shami, Galawati, Boti, Patili-ke-Kababs, Seekh and Ghutwa Kababs. Each piece is succulent, perfectly spice exudes a distinct aroma and really melts in the mouth. Other items of Awadhi cuisine i.e., biryanis, nahari-kulchas, roomali rotis and warqi parathasare a must-have.
Lucknow is a haven for the exquisite chikankari on cotton the perfect fabric for the sweltering India summer. Available everywhere at pocket-friendly rates. If you are looking for upmarket stuff head to Hazratganj a famous shopping area of old Lucknow.
